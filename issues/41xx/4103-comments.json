The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (only in that session) as well as (globally) adding the path to `/etc/ld.so.conf'.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn general: If you build BerkeleyDB from scratch, build only the static library (--with-static) not the shared one (--without-shared). It will not need the static library at runtime, which makes the executable more self-contained (this is the same as done for the gitian builds).\r\n\r\nClosing this as it's more of a question than an actual issue.\r\n",
