   "body" : "[centos 6.5, current bitcoin version] I seem to have successfully compiled bitcoind, however, when I try to run it, I get the following:\n\n`./bitcoind: error while loading shared libraries: libdb_cxx-4.8.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`\n\nHaving followed the directions here, I downloaded and compiled 4.8 source, but I can't seem to get any BerkeleyDB.4.8 folders to be generated in /usr/local.\nI have, however, located libdb_cxx-4.8.so in db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/.libs\n\nIf I simply copy or reference this .so file in the correct places, should that resolve the issue?\nUsing 'locate libdb_cxx' I get entries for 'libdb_cxx.so' and 'libdb_cxx-4.7.so' in /usr/lib64, but that's all.\n\nShould I point bitcoin/src/m4/bitcoin_find_bdb48.m4, line:7, to\n'bdbdirlist=/root/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/.libs' ?  (the db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/build/include directory mentioned above does not exist for me).\n\nCopying libdb_cxx-4.8.so do /usr/lib64 does not seem to resolve the issue.\n\nMy apologies in advance for my limited understanding.  I'm still getting up to speed with several layers of abstraction involved here.  Thanks in advance.
