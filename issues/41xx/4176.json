   "body" : "As discussed on #bitcoin-dev it happens that a large number of Bitcoin has been lost by users misunderstanding the gravity of the situation when playing with private keys. Online tutorials encourage users to use the `importprivkey` and `dumpprivkey` commands in general situations, leading to cases where they unwittingly erase their wallets or otherwise compromise them (private key to QR code websites were mentioned). \r\n\r\nI propose that large warnings are given when executing these commands from the RPC console to attempt to give the user a sense of how much risk is involved in this action. A gate that requires a clickthrough or a written out message \"I understand how dangerous this is\" would do. More radically the commands could be removed altogether or hidden when a switch is not given at startup time.\r\n\r\nRelevant discussions can be found in the logs for the development channel for half an hour ago.",
