This causes the child process to inherit\r\nthe open file descriptors. (Only for *nixes.) So I had to add some \"fcntl\" to prevent file descriptor leaks.\r\nThere could still be some leaked, for example on my system with qt5, leaked descriptors for \"/dev/ati/card0\"\r\nget added every restart. But we dynamically raise file descriptor limit and exit if not enough available.\r\nOn my system the max limit is a million by default, so I doubt that this will cause a problem to anybody, and even if, we would just exit with \"Not enough file descriptors available.\"\r\n\r\nWindows does not have this issue, because there is a flag for this and QProcess::startDetached calls CreateProcess() with bInheritHandles=false.\r\nI checked the qt source code and tested this with process explorer on windows, and indeed, no handle leftovers there.\r\n\r\nTested\r\n - Linux (qt4.8, qt5.2)\r\n - Windows 7 64bit qt5.2 (32 and 64 bit executables)",
