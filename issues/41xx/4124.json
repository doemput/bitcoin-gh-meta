   "body" : "When using bitcoind as a wallet-less full node, it would be useful to be able to run it as a system service, so that it starts automatically at startup and can be controlled though the OS's normal service start and stop functionality.\r\n\r\nFor the Debian/Ubuntu side of things see hippich and fungus' posts here: https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=965.0 . It'd make most sense to integrate this into the PPA. There are two different systems in use here: old-style sysv init scripts, and upstart.\r\n\r\nFor Windows/OSX I'm not sure what is necessary. At least we'd need new installer packages, separate from the normal \"Bitcoin Core Wallet\" which provide a node and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe installer would also need to create user credentials to run under.\r\n\r\nEdit: for the service install, this would also imply moving the configuration to a system-wide instead of user location, for example `/etc/bitcoin.conf` as well as default the data directory to a system-scope location (probably `/var/lib/bitcoin`).\r\n",
