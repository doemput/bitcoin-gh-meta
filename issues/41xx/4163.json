Given the code (if param[0] is true then unlock, otherwise lock), the command ***probably*** should have been named unlockunspent. The Right Thing&trade; would be to fix the semantics of the first param to mean \"lock\" rather than \"unlock\" if the current command name is to be kept. But here's to living with a legacy of bad decisions upon which others have come to rely. :o)\r\n\r\n(The [Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Raw_Transactions#lockunspent_unlock.3F_.5B.7B.22txid.22:txid.2C.22vout.22:n.7D.2C....5D) also needs updating.)",
