It doesn't make sense that we would recommend that users should consider short-circuiting that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the characterization of the change to priority is incorrect (that is \"no longer updated correctly\"); a more correct statement would be that we've changed the definition of priority so that we only age inputs that were confirmed at the time the transaction was received.  The description here suggests that a bug was introduced, but we discussed this very issue when the changes were made, and it was clearly an intentional change -- even if not everyone agrees with it.\r\n\r\nFor discussion of the intentional change to the priority calculation, please see here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7008\r\n",

Even for miners that care strongly about continuing to support what priority txs remain, I would highly recommend that they use 0.12 and its modified notion of priority.

The definition of priority and its surrounding policy is arbitrary (rate limited, using fee as a limit, sorted after dividing by an arbitrary modified size), and it has changed several times. Why does it matter to maintain its exact same semantics? It at worst affects a tiny minority of transactions, and is always fixed by resubmitting. It won't affect things in practice.\r\n\r\nMiners are free to run whatever policy code they prefer, so we should be honest about the changes we're making in the software we're producing.

Because the rpc is out of the critical path its acceptable for its cost function to be slow.\r\n\r\nThe internal design is driven by efficiency and must be. Structuring it as a fully general GetCost would result in txin lookups for each transaction and re-sorting the whole mempool every time createnewblock is called. This is the difference between milliseconds of computation and seconds. Some miners that violate the protocol by extending a blockchain without verifying it, or skipping transaction processing may not care about CreateNewBlock speed... but others do greatly.\r\n\r\nThe combination if a lightning fast internal decision coupled with RPC policy lets miners safely twiddle their policy without reliability risks and without delays that result in zero-tx blocks or skipping validation. Hopefully it is the best of all worlds.\r\n\r\nWhat do you need that isn't yet being provided?\r\n",

It sounds like priority transactions' won't be mined even if they meet the fee or that the rpc isn't functional.\r\n\r\nLet me try:\r\n\r\n Relay and Mining: Priority transactions\r\n ---------------------------------------\r\n \r\nBitcoin Core has a heuristic 'priority' based on coin value and age for transactions which do not meet pay\r\nthe minimum relay fee. Bitcoin Core relays and mines these transactions depending on the setting of `-limitfreerelay=<r>` (default: `r=15` kB per minute) and `-blockprioritysize=<s>`.\r\n \r\nIn Bitcoin Core 0.12 when mempool limit has been reached a higher minimum relay fee takes effect to limit memory usage. Transactions which do not meet this higher effective minimum relay fee will not be relayed or mined even if they would rank highly according to the priority heuristic if they were accepted.\r\n\r\nIn Bitcoin Core 0.12 the reserved space for priority heuristic selected transactions is also set to zero.  \r\nTo re-enable it, simply set `-blockprioritysize=<n>` where <n> is the size in bytes of your\r\n blocks to reserve for these transactions. The old default was 50k, so to retain the same policy, you would set `-blockprioritysize=50000`.\r\n \r\nAdditionally, as a result of computational simplifications, the priority value used for transactions received with unconfirmed inputs is lower than in prior versions to due avoiding recomputing the amounts as transactions confirm.\r\n\r\nExternal miner policy set via the prioritisetransaction RPC to rank transactions already in the mempool continues to work as it has previously.\r\n \r\nThis internal automatic prioritization handling is being considered for removal entirely in Bitcoin Core 0.13. Community direction on this topic is particularly requested to help set project priorities.",
