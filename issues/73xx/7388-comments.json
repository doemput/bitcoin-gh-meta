I do however think this due to a misunderstanding:\r\n* It's perfectly possible to keep accepting 0-conf transactions, if you believe they are safe for your use case. Opt-in RBF sets a non-maximum nSequence value, which causes many providers to already consider the transaction non-standard for the purpose of accepting 0-conf.\r\n* As a customer, you can choose to set opt-in RBF, and thus lose the ability to get your payment accepted before confirmation, but with the ability to easily change the fee afterwards or combine the transaction with others.\r\n* As a miner, the rational behaviour is to take the transaction with the highest fee (even for non opt-in cases). If you don't, another miner can.\r\n\r\nAnd, no, opt-in RBF is not theft. It's indicating that you're not sure whether what you're submitting is the final form of the transaction. This is the exact semantics that nSequence had since the earliest version of Bitcoin.\r\n",

That would be possible.\r\n\r\nBut most (all) wallets do already treat unconfirmed transactions/balance as **unconfirmed**. People should really not rely on **unconfirmed** balance. It's **unconfirmed**. ~~As recently shown by Peter Todd, it's quite easy to double spend your transaction, and this was without RBF being deployed.~~ If they rely on 0-conf they should use a merchant tools which includes risk analysis. \r\n\r\nIf you are selling services or goods after you have received a 0-conf transaction, you should be very careful with handing out the good/service while the transaction is **not confirmed** and you should certainly not use a standard wallet (you would take a very high risk).

They must also come up with new workflows to deal with clientele who accidentally flag transactions as RBF.  Most retailers wont bother with this hassle (at best) and potentially ignorant retailers will lose a lot of money (at worst). This policy change (and by policy i am referring to the default settings since 99% of node operators will not change the defaults) is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb on the retailer community.  ",

This is something that you should know all about and show us before you implement such dramatic changes to policy.\r\n\r\nSipa is saying that there are no services which accept 0-conf transactions that accept non-final transactions. Since opt-in makes it non-final, they are already prepared for that. He (and everyone else on the team) has already looked at the services and have already determined that they all already deal with non-final transactions. He is saying that you would not be able to find any service that doesn't already deal with those non-final 0-conf transactions because they all do.\r\n\r\n> I think it is really bad the way you guys are trying to force bitcoin into lightningcoin.

Do those who were part of that survey actually know what Opt-In RBF even means?\r\n\r\n@skajake Any service who already accepts 0-conf transactions will already check for certain things to be sure that the incoming transaction will be confirmed. One of them is the nSequence, and if it is not MAX_INT, then the transaction is non-final. Even if they do not upgrade, this code is already there because an nSequence that is not MAX_INT is already considered non-final and thus dangerous to accept 0-conf on. Thus that is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nAlso, if they only accept transactions with confirmations (as many do), then this doesn't matter to the retailer.",

For instance devs re: RBF talk about having had consensus months ago. Should we not strive for a much more robust definition of consensus to be used going forward? Maybe that way we can avoid a separation in dev consensus and user consensus that Jeff is referring to that can be seen in the consider.it polling.",

There's no extra risk when doing so.\r\n\r\nIt just increases flexibility to have this available. There are lots of complaints about stuck transactions that never confirm.

It is not very useful if only a few nodes support it.\r\n\r\n@petertodd's full-RBF patch solves this by adding a version bits so that nodes that support full RBF can find each other. That's the other path. It allows some users to use RBF without marking transactions in a way that opt-in RBF does.\r\n\r\nOpt-in RBF is a compromise that keeps the sanity. Users that want to use RBF can do so without harming users that don't want to use it. Full RBF on the other hand allows full double spending and (absent other precautions) makes zero-conf completely useless.\r\n\r\nIt's naive to think that keeping back opt-in RBF will also discourage full RBF. If anything, some users and miners have got so annoyed by this political maneuvering that they've started to support full RBF.\r\n",

Opt-in RBF was proposed as a compromise to make both RBF supporters and the status quo happy. If the compromise fails, both groups go back to their extremes. People that want to use RBF will do so, by the means available (the full RBF patch). In contrast to this compromise, that doesn't need to be widely adapted (or \"forced down the throats of users\", who's trolling?) to be useful. But it is much more \"dangerous\" as it contains no flagging of transactions that can be replaced.\r\n",

All I'm saying is that if opt-in RBF doesn't  solve the only problem full RBF had IMO (being controversial ) then we could have as well not gone through the effort of removing all potential sources of controversy (that's why I understand optin does compared to full) because although the logic has changed the policy still contains \"RBF\" in its name whic is (from what I can read in this PR) the real reason why opt-in RBF is controversial  (haven't all other on-topic concerns risen here been refuted?).\r\n",
