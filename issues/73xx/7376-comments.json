Essentially anything that uses OP_RETURN is currently incompatible with Payments.

If you give an OP_RETURN a > dust value, Bitcoin Core will process it (how I created that transaction on blockinfo). I can't imagine why this would be supported since it destroys value. \r\n\r\nThe two potential fixes are:\r\n\r\n1. Allow *only* zero value OP_RETURN in PaymentDetails as I suggest.\r\n2. Don't allow any OP_RETURN scripts.\r\n\r\nRight now we have a situation where only OP_RETURNs with value are supported which seems like the worst of all options.",

Even though some people (like yourself) would rather **no** data be encoded on the blockchain, OP_RETURN gave people a less damaging way to do what they were going to do anyway.\r\n\r\nNow with zero value payments the situation is the same. I *could* shutdown key.run and call it a day since destroying value is suboptimal. Or I could just burn 6,000 satoshi per transaction and keep moving forward.\r\n\r\nAlso, from a pure design perspective I would say it's definitely a smell to have such broken functionality live.",

That's why it's important to  put it on the blockchain. As a merchant, you could message your user outside of the protocol but the message would be temporal, would rely on a great deal of trust that the values stick around and never change and generally encourage centralized behavior (to broadcast and store the messages). By allowing OP_RETURN you open the door for distributed applications that can't be built by removing the data from the Bitcoin protocol and handling it on another channel.\r\n\r\nTo go back to my particular use case, you could fire up your own copy of key.run on your machine right now and the db would be reconstituted from the blockchain. I could be hit by a bus and the service would continue uninterrupted (if anyone was using it :).\r\n",
