Everyone can submit a BIP and becomes the author of that.\r\n\r\nThe most that you can do is mail the author of the specific BIP with your concerns/issues. But as said, be aware that BIPs like BIP22 are set in stone by sake of being implemented by a lot of different software. So the only way to propose an extension is to create a new BIP (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki for information on creating BIPs), not by changing the old one.\r\n",
