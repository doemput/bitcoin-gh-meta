Will check the disk, too.\r\n\r\nThe machine is totally not up to the task and on several occasions went into emergency shutdown due to overheating. Which of course also increases chances for disc failure a bit but for now I'll just check things out and assume this was it. So the UTXO set has no integrity check yet? There's talks of putting the UTXO-set hash into the block header, right?",
