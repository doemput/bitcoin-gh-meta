   "body" : "(I already sent this to bitcoin-dev and it was rejected by the moderator with a nice letter saying that they appreciated it and would forward it to the appropriate parties. Since I don't know who the appropriate parties are or how to communicate with them, and since I want to have a public, linkable, and permanent copy of this request, I'm opening this ticket. I hope you don't mind the use of the issue tracker for this purpose. I feel that it is borderline but is an appropriate use of the issue tracker.)\r\n\r\nDear Bitcoin Core folks:\r\n\r\nI really appreciate\r\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/2016-01-07-statement, and\r\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases-faq, and\r\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases.\r\n\r\nI feel that having succinct and specific statements like this are very\r\nhelpful, for users and potential collaborators. I feel like that even,\r\nor especially, when I personally disagree with some of the assertions\r\nor strategies stated therein. So thank you very much for taking the\r\neffort to do it!\r\n\r\nI do have one request: would you please disclose the names of the\r\nauthors? I understand that the statement has been ACKed by a number of\r\npeople, but that's not the same thing. I also understand that there\r\nare presumably multiple authors, and a grey area of people who\r\ncontributed a little, but perhaps not enough to be counted as\r\nco-authors. Despite all those difficulties, having the names of\r\nauthors of statements like this is important, both for evaluation, for\r\nfacilitating communication, and for the historical record.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you're uncomfortable publicly claiming your\r\nauthorship of a document like this, then please pick a persistent nom\r\nde plume for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI feel that this is important, and that by publicly signing your name\r\nto your words you can significantly increase the positive impact that\r\nyour words can have.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nZooko",
