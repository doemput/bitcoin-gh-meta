From https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4545#issuecomment-209938408:\r\n\r\n> Seems I'll just have to set a deadline: I'm going to remove use of the unmaintained java-based comparison framework after the 0.13 branch-off (projected  2016-07-06, see #7679). I hope the Python framework will be a full replacement by then, but as this is holding up progress in other areas, that will not affect the decision.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke worded it quite well too:\r\n\r\n> If they don't and no one knows how to fix, we can remove them right now. Because the only thing they'd be doing then, is slowing down travis.\r\n\r\n- The effort of porting the java comparison tool to Python is going very well, see e.g. #8141. If there is something left to do, I'm sure it can be resolved before the 0.14 release.\r\n- The test is blocking changes such as #7093 (Address mempool information leak and resource wasting attacks).\r\n- This test takes quite a while and is holding up enabling the tests for win32: #8227.\r\n\r\nThis removes all the support for the tool, and removes it from depends (and hopefully all other references to it).\r\n\r\nNot to be backported to 0.13.\r\n\r\n",
