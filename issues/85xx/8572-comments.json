I guess the other place to \"fix\" this is to change it so that pruning nodes still advertise as NODE_NETWORK. Perhaps that is a better solution, and then upon connection the node can establish how far back its blocks go. Storing the services bits in the address database was a nice idea - perhaps it can also store additional services which aren't also stored in the services version messages, such as whether a node is pruned, and use this bit instead of the NODE_NETWORK bit currently being used. If this is an ok idea, I can go ahead and create a pull for this functionality (unless someone else wants to do it).\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on some other changes which can better determine what value a node is providing, such as whether it's giving usful txs, speedily delivering blocks etc, and then could use this in determining when to evict outgoing connections (in a similar way to the incoming connections evictions but based on different parameters). I'd ideally like to be able to display some of these metrics in the Peers Debug pane, but I'm not up to speed enough on Qt to program this and anyway, I think a webpage would be a better way to display it as that could also be served by bitcoind too.",

It can still mean this, but by making pruned nodes not have this flag, it is changing the meaning. Before pruning nodes existed, no one was defining NETWORK_NODE as specifically as \"a node that provides blocks all the way from the latest block to the genesis block\" because it was understood that NETWORK_NODEs were the nodes to connect to to get blocks. The meaning needs to stay up to date just as much as the code does. As things evolve, ambiguity often slips in, and I think it's important to be careful how we redefine things as part of that evolution.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell noted. I meant to include the word \"effectively\" (I thought I did). It doesn't use the ban function, but by omiting them form the advertised addresses shared among nodes, they are effectively banished, wouldn't you agree?",

I'm in agreement that the code needs refining as we need to ensure a minimum number of NODE_NETWORKS nodes to connect to, which these changes would not guarantee, admittedly.  Have changed to [WIP], as I'm working on refining this, although perhaps closing it is better for now...\r\n\r\nThe work I refer to is to make use of pruned nodes better than we currently do - i.e. connecting to non NODE_NETWORK nodes (in addition to a minimal number of NODE_NETWORK nodes) but not making so many assumptions about the service bits - i.e. testing both NODE_NETWORK and non-NODE_NETWORK nodes to see what services they are providing. I realise in the future that the services available will become more clearly advertised but I still prefer to make the code assume as little as possible - I even have a pull request in the pipeline that makes nodes almost totally ignore the nVersion of a node for these same non-assumptive ethics.",
