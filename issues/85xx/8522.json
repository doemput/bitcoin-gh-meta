Hopefully, the assertion condition can help you find the problem.\r\n\r\nI was reindexing my blocks because I needed `txindex`. The reindex is complete at the time of the crash. The GUI shows \"synchronizing with network...\" at 17 weeks behind. The blocks that I was reindexing were copied from v0.11 into v0.12.1 (64-bit). The command line is `bitcoin-qt.exe  -server -rpcuser=xxx -rpcpassword=xxx -rpcbind=xxx -rpcallowip=xxx -txindex -reindex`. Before running that command I deleted `chainstate`, `database` and `db.log`.\r\n\r\nThe log shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n************************\r\nEXCEPTION: St9bad_alloc       \r\nstd::bad_alloc       \r\nC:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe in ProcessMessages()       \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it looks like an OOM condition triggers this bug. It would be helpful if Bitcoin Core supported low memory conditions gracefully.\r\n\r\nAnd now:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12032350/17698822/8c237694-63bd-11e6-910a-ae53a0ae9640.png)\r\n\r\nLooks like I will be rebuilding for 2 days *again* :( For a week now I am doing nothing else because the database gets corrupted so easily. I really wish Bitcoin Core was crash consistent. This is running on a clean VM so I don't think the machine is somehow messed up.",
