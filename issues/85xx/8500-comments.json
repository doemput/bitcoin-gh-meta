FWIW, first prototype was in [Dec, 2015](https://github.com/ptschip/bitcoinxt/commit/7ea5854a3599851beffb1323544173f03d45373b#diff-1df47808b82268c616535e7b20216dfbR157).\r\n\r\nI agree the BUIP should mention this enum. Lessons learned I suppose. It's also IMHO a good idea to at least peek at the existing wheel when re-inventing a new one. Extending this enum is an obvious way to request a new block type and xthin is not exactly a hidden gem.\r\n\r\n@jameshilliard: Nodes supporting xthin need to respond correctly to MSG_THINBLOCK - even though MSG_XTHINBLOCK is mostly used.\r\n\r\nIf Core cannot change to an available enum value itÃ¢ÂÂs probably possible to derive its meaning from context. If a node has sent Ã¢ÂÂsendcmpctÃ¢ÂÂ it means MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK, if not then it means MSG_THINBLOCK. Both the BIP and the BUIP could be updated to reflect this.",

As far as I know the _only_ consequence of the index reuse is that an implementation couldn't support both protocols simultaneously on a single connection. That is it.  It would make no logical sense to run both since they both accomplish the same thing (though BIP152 does so more simply and efficiently).\r\n\r\nIf \"xthin\" actually had a written specification or had this concern otherwise been raised earlier I would have argued that both should use the same enum, as they both do the same thing and they both couldn't logically be used at the same time. So through xthin's lack of documentation we ended up with a result that was the same as what I would have argued for had the question been raised.\r\n\r\nThe issue is doubly moot when, presumably due to a lack of a specification, the existing \"xthin\" implementations are already incompatible with each other. (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/commit/833cd35dcaa79fa3e91f271458ce44c085ea60a2 ); and if something did have to change-- right now I observe five currently-BIP152-using peers for every XT+Classic+Unlimited peer (and only 'unlimited' even has released support for 'xthin'). \r\n",

Secondly, there was also public peer review and code review for the bip152 proposal, bip152 draft, and a public implementation of bip152 for code review as well, all of which were excellent opportunities for collaboration and analysis of any perceived potential problems.\r\n\r\nThankfully, it seems like this is not an actual issue, as discussed above, such as in terms of the network layer. However, this serves as an interesting example of how it's useful to communicate with other Bitcoin developers through BIPs and other communication.\r\n\r\nI am not presently convinced regarding the claims of \"asked to recall my products from a market\" and \"p2p layer breakage\" and \"showstopper\".
