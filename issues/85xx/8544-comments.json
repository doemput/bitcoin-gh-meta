All commands in the console are potentially sensitive, including `listaccounts`. \r\nNo precautionary measure should create issues for heavy console users. No console command, including `listaccounts`, should be executed if its result are to be shared with a person who shouldn't have that info. \r\n\r\nWhere to put a warning:\r\n* Settings > Options > Advanced\r\n* Enable command console features (checkbox)\r\n * Here put a click-through warning\r\n\r\nI would prefer something like this: `The sharing of information from Debug Console or allowing other persons to directly or indirectly operate it may lead to a complete and irrecoverable loss of wallet contents. <small>Please consult Bitcoin Core User Guide for additional information on high-risk console commands.</small>`\r\n\r\nMost people won't consider the helpful guy from computer store around the corner a scammer so that word isn't a good choice (it can even make one get more easily scammed by a non-scammer type). \r\nUsers generally shouldn't readily permit anyone access the Console. Other tabs in Help > Debug are okay, and there's a Reset Options button for easy \"restart\", so there's no reason for any 3rd party to need access to the console or its output, whether they're Tech Support from your bitcoin exchange or scammers from (feel free to stereotype a country of your choosing).\r\n",
