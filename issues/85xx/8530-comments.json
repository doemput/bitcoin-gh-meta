      "body" : "@mcccs Transactions do not have a \"from\" address. That is not how Bitcoin works.\r\n\r\nEach individual input refers to a previous transaction's output, and that previous output may have been sent to a recognizable address before. This is what block explorers show you, but it is very bad practice. In particular:\r\n* **You can't use it to identify the sender**. Many wallets do not necessarily send from a known address, and CoinJoin intentionally makes it impossible.\r\n* **You can't use it to send money back to the sender**. Not every wallet expects money back, and shared wallets may credit the wrong user if you do. You need to ask for a new address. Furthermore, address reuse like this hurts the privacy of the receiver and everyone they interact with (including yourself).\r\n* **There may be multiple addresses**. Every input can have one. Which one do you show? What if there are different amounts for each?\r\n* **There may be no addresses**. For example in the case of more complicated transactions and contracts, there may not be any identifiable address at all.\r\n* **It may be your own address**. In some cases (such a 2-of-2 escrow between sender and receiver), one of the \"sender addresses\" may even be your own.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Bitcoin Core will not show this; it is unreliable at best, and confusing at worst.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know who sent you money, give them an individualized address and label the address with the name of that person or entity. Bitcoin Core will correctly show it.",
