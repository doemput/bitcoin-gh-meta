   "body" : "This is an alternative to #8451.\r\n\r\nInstead of making CTransaction mutable-but-with-cached-hash, it makes it actually fully immutable and never modifies any of its elements (apart from wit) after construction.\r\n\r\nTo do so, we heavily rely on C++11. CTransaction gets a (CMutableTransaction&&) constructor that efficiently converts a CMutableTransaction into a CTransaction without copying. In addition, CTransaction gets a deserializing constructors.\r\n\r\nOne downside is that CWalletTx cannot easily inherent from CTransaction anymore, as CWalletTx needs a way to modify the CTransaction data inside. By turning the superclass into a CTransactionRef field, it can take advantage (not implemented yet) of sharing CTransactions with the mempool.",
