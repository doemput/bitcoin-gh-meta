I did a pull request where I [could've tried to code three different paths based on the version of Qt used](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4606#issuecomment-50818492). @theuni [kinda sorta maybe said versions <5.2 could be ignored](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4606#issuecomment-50904473) but I'm not sure how much should be invested in that statement.\r\n\r\nDoes this help in any way? Whether or not it does, it would be nice to establish a Qt5 minimum, and possibly think about whether or not Qt4 should still be supported.",
