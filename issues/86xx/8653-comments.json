No POSIX emulation layer is needed for c++11 threads. However the problem with `<mutex>` and friends on newer Ubuntu's mingw-w64 seems to be the following:\r\n\r\n- Firstly, there is a `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/5.3-win32/include/c++/mutex`. However the definition of the actual class is guarded by `_GLIBCXX_HAS_GTHREADS`.\r\n- However it requires building glibcxx with a certain library (not to be confused with GLIB's \"libgthread\"):\r\n    - `_GLIBCXX_HAS_GTHREADS` is supposed to be defined in `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/5.3-win32/include/c++/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bits/c++config.h` when this has been done\r\n\r\nThis is an Ubuntu-specific problem: the \"gthreads\" (GCC threads) library is not linked into libcxx.\r\n\r\nOn Trusty this is not an issue as gthreads is provided:\r\n- `/usr/include/c++/4.8/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bits/c++config.h` defines `_GLIBCXX_HAS_GTHREADS`.\r\n\r\nThere is a https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads which some people use to work around this problem. But in principle I think Ubuntu should solve this upstream.",

The tests pass (at least in wine) without `--stack-protector-all`. It also makes Bitcoin-Qt with wallet start again. \r\n\r\nSo apparently there are three, at most tangentially related issues regarding Windows:\r\n\r\n- The `std::mutex` `std::condition_variable` etc problem on Ubuntu 15.10+. Can apparently be solved by enabling POSIX compatibility, or by using something like https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads.\r\n\r\n- `-fstack-protector-all` issue (`-fstack-protector` doesn't have this problem, neither do the other hardening flags like nxcompat) - causes the tests to crash at startup (before even getting to our code in BasicTestingSetup!), as well as bitcoin-qt to crash at startup *if the wallet is enabled*.\r\n\r\n- libevent 'zu' header issue - causes bitcoin-cli and bitcoind to be unable to connect over RPC (which as mentioned by @sstone, looks like https://sourceforge.net/p/levent/bugs/363/) (fixed in #8730)\r\n\r\nI wonder when each of these issues started.

I wonder what happened in the meantime, I just checked and the 0.13.0 executables don't suffer from this issue. There have been no libevent version changes in depends since then (we've always been using 2.0.22). So it must be an issue with the combination of the new compiler and libevent.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit afraid that the patch, if we were to apply it to depends, will introduce a similar issue (but backwards) on Trusty instead.
