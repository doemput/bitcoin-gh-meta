I felt this was a genuine issue given that I had mistakenly used the whitebind option to make all connections connecting to an interface be whitelisted - it was only after realising my node had been uncontactable from the internet for 5 days that I realised this command line options causes all other interfaces to stop listening. This is (given my experience) obviously not clear (to at least 1 person, I suspect I am not alone).\r\n\r\nThis issue was raised to earmark a resolution to this. Not sure why you have closed it considering it is still outstanding.",
