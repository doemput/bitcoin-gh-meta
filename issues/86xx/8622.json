   "body" : "This code causes no functional difference to bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the pull is also to help make the code more readable by making variable names fit their function. \r\n\r\n1. The first commit moves the debug message for version number to before the disconnect logic so that the debug.log will show the version of nodes connected to, however briefly. This seems reasonable given that a version message is received - it now ensures it is logged.\r\n3. The second commit changed nServicesExpected so that it is what is in the address database, thereby making the variable function closer to the variable name.",
