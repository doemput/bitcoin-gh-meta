   "body" : "According to #8639 and #8640, Qt 4.6 is no longer supported by Core. There's a zombie Qt patch that doesn't seem to be used or referenced anywhere. So, I've removed it.\r\n\r\nI have a related question for @theuni or anybody else who can answer. What is the oldest supported version of Qt 5? There's a small bit of code I'd like to clean up. The exact coding method depends on which versions of Qt are supported.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
