   "body" : "**Status: Tested and seems to work**\n\n1. Guarantee listtransactions order consistency by storing a position for each entry\n2. Add \"blocktime\" and (for wallet transactions) \"timereceived\" to transaction Objects\n3. Implement \"smart\" times according to the following logic:\n - If sending a transaction, assign its timestamp to the current time.\n - If receiving a transaction outside a block, assign its timestamp to the current time.\n - If receiving a block with a future timestamp, assign all its (not already known) transactions' timestamps to the current time.\n - If receiving a block with a past timestamp, before the most recent known transaction (that we care about), assign all its (not already known) transactions' timestamps to the same timestamp as that most-recent-known transaction.\n - If receiving a block with a past timestamp, but after the most recent known transaction, assign all its (not already known) transactions' timestamps to the block time.\n\nThis supercedes #1159.\nDiscussion: https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=54527",
