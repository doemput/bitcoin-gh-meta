   "body" : "There are some problems with people copying and pasting an address where the address includes an unprintable character.  \n\nFor example, some web apps will inject an #8203; into a long word so that a line-break / word wrap will occur.  But the user doing a copy and paste won't see this character.\n - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2973698/whats-html-character-code-8203\n\nWhen trying to paste this into the PayTo: field of v0.6.2, the paste does not succeed.  There is no feedback given as to why this paste does not occur.\n\nIn previous versions (perhaps v0.5.x/) apparently the paste will success but the validation fails on send (highlights the field in red).  Still though there is no further feedback as to what the problem is. \n\nThe user then feels the problem is with Bitcoin-Qt as that same copy and paste on an EWallet (e.g., on Mt. Gox website) works fine (presumably because they strip out nonprintable characters from an address?)\n\n\nHere's an example of users reporting this issue:\n - http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=82004.0\n\nHere's what the \"view source\" for the web page shows:\n   1G5apmPvo2iTtmkNWAHTCET7&#8203;Y842Ufijs8\n",
