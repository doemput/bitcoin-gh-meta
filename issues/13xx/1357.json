This allows all internal code to only use the internal types, and only have RPC and GUI depend on the base58 code.\n\nFurthermore, the header dependencies are a lot saner now. base58.h is at the top (right below rpc and gui) instead of at the bottom. For the rest: wallet -> script -> keystore -> key. Only keystore still requires a forward declaration of CScript. Solving that would require splitting script into two layers.",
