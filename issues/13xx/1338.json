(although there will be a pull request coming shortly providing a command line flag should peer information for all txs be desired).\n\nAlso, free transactions are identifies in the output. Not particularly useful, but these may become a rare thing in the not too distant future.. maybe, maybe not.\n\nApologies for the txnode variable. The only other way was to change all the functions to allow it to be passed. I think this is the neatest and least intrusive way, and can't see any harm in it, but please correct me if I'm wrong here.",
