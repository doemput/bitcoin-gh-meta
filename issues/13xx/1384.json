   "body" : "I just accidentally sent coins to the wrong address due to a misunderstanding of how the client works.  I think there are a couple of usability issues which contributed to this happening, as well as my own carelessness.\n\nWhat I did:\n\n* go to the 'send' tab\n* paste an address into the 'pay to' box.  the 'label' automatically was filled in, confirming that I typed the right address\n* clicked the first icon to the right of the 'pay to' box to see the address book\n* looked to see if the address was in there.  it wasn't.  clicked 'ok' to dismiss the dialog\n* back at the 'send' tab, the label field was still showing the right value, so I didn't notice that the 'ok' in the previous step had changed the 'pay to' field\n* typed an amount and hit 'send'.\n\nThe amount ended up going to the first address in my address book, not to the address with the label that was displayed when I clicked 'send'.\n\nTwo comments:\n\n* when the address book is first opened up, I'd prefer if no address was selected, rather than the first (no label) address.  I hadn't selected an address, so thought that 'ok' would leave everything unchanged.\n\n* when I click 'ok' in the address book causing an address to be copied to the 'pay to' box of the 'send' tab, update the 'label' field (or lack of label) accordingly.  currently it leaves the label field unchanged which is misleading.  I checked the label field before hitting send, and it was still showing the label I wanted to send to.  But the address had been changed, and that is where the funds went.",
