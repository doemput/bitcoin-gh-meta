This change adds the command line option \"-logtxpeer\", which when chosen, will cause the peer to be reported for every transaction received, including invalid transactions.\n\nAs this is useful only for debugging, and not needed for general use of bitcoin, the option is not displayed in the syntax output, but only found when browsing the code.",
