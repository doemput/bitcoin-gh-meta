   "body" : "So I thought I'd spend my sunday afternoon porting my GUI to the newest bitcoin git version. I got lost in the forest on the first file I tried to compile, though;\r\n\r\nqt/bitcoin.cpp (mine) includes util.h\r\nutil.h includes uint256.h\r\nuint256.h includes serialize.h \r\nserialize.h includes wallet.h\r\nwallet.h includes bignum.h\r\nbignum.h includes utl.h\r\n\r\nThat's one epic dependency loop. I see no trivial way to split it up (like adding forward declaration), as there is a lot of inline code in the headers that uses the actual types. \r\n\r\nOf course, I could get my hacksaw and saw off pieces here and there until this until it compiles again. But it might be better to make an actual plan as to how to split up the includes. How is this *supposed* to work?\r\n\r\n",
