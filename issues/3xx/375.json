I personally\r\nthink he's full of crap. It doesn't matter. We are locked into one hashing\r\nalgorithm and this sort of rumour exposes a weakness that we needn't have.\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\niEYEAREDAAYFAk4QLG8ACgkQ2p+H2HZY90HiEgCfYvQZYdsHJUT4aEasuqLlEFHi\r\nrVwAmwcSs9WyumpJq4y8bnRXOXOsq+x8\r\n=TCoE\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n",
