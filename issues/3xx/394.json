   "body" : "I'm pull-requesting this so that people know this stuff exists.\r\nConsider it as low priority, and If there's some interest in it, I might keep this up to date for some time.\r\n\r\nPluses:\r\n- Command line and configuration files are fully parsed before being taken into account, errors are reported (including misspelled or unknown parameters).\r\n- A nice interface is provided to access options & configuration from source code (cf. option.h).\r\n- Single definition of options and default values, which have been moved to the top of .cpp files.\r\n- Checks for integer overflows in configuration values.\r\n- New rpc command \"reloadconfig\" to dynamically update configuration parameters (Issue #309). Command line parameters will not be overridden. Notice that many core parameters are used only during startup.\r\n- Option -conf is now enough to configure everything (Issue #140).\r\n- A way to force listing of hidden options (-help=allopts) and access to help messages is possible even if bitcoin is already running.\r\n- Fix erroneous error message with respect to the path of the configuration file when using -testnet (Issue #241).\r\n- Removed '\\n' and other data from translatable strings (Issue #313).\r\n- Using boost to deal with most filesystem paths.\r\n- Slightly faster access to configuration values (no map lookups).\r\n\r\nMinuses:\r\n- Access to configuration values are a bit less recognizable in source code.\r\n- Relies a little deeper on boost (but without added dependencies).\r\n- Uses some hacks around boost::program_options to recover original bitcoin command line style.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This has been tested a little bit on unix (linux), needs to be tested on other arches (Windows).",
