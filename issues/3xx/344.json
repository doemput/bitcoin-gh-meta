   "body" : "HI!\r\n\r\nI'm one of the founders of Bitcoins.lc - we're experiencing some problems with bitcoind as a backend.\r\nThe error consists of mainly that the amount of connections between bitcoind and pushpoold is insane.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact the bitcoind does not support keep-alive for RPC-connections. pushpoold is based upon libcurl and should be able to do so out of the box. Each new getwork request from clients opens up a new connection between bitcoind and pushpoold to transfeer data.\r\n\r\nCould anyone please take a look at this problem?\r\nI'd gladly pay 10 BTC for implementing a keep-alive patch for bitcoin.\r\n\r\n/ jim",
