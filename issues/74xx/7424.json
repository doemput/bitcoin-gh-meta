   "body" : "Fixes #7420. This was discussed and agreed upon a long time ago, but I never got around to actually doing it. Sorry to do this during the rc stage, @laanwj, but at least it was discovered before final release.\r\n\r\nThanks very much to @dlogemann for testing the rcs and reporting the issue.\r\n\r\nThis fixes glibc back-compat issues with the current toolchain, and adds the checks to gitian so that breakage won't go unnoticed again. With a few more tweaks, it should be safe enough to add to 'make check' so that Travis tests with each build, but not quite yet.\r\n\r\nI've verified that Gitian builds for Linux/Win are successful, OSX should be unchanged.",
