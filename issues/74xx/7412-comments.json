This makes it impractical.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to support optional block compression over the P2P protocol, but don't change local handling; see #6973.\r\n\r\nThough isavings add up to a lot (you'd need to quantify them) they could be part of a future hardfork.\r\nSee also https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlist\r\n\r\nNote that some of the fields which have been effectively ignored in the past have recently gained a more important role:\r\n- nLockTime is set by the wallet for every transaction to protect against fee sniping\r\n- nSequence in the input is used to signal opting in to RBF\r\n",

Since there is a chance of a hard fork down the road, I'll write some code to transform blocks into the suggested format and see what the numbers look like.\r\n\r\n@laanwj I spent some time reading #6973. My guess is gzip/deflate is able to perform well because there are so many occurrences of 0x00 bytes and 0xff bytes. My intention is to remove these bytes altogether so more transactions can fit within a single block, before compression is applied for relaying.\r\n\r\nIf someone does have any related ideas, please share them here so I can include those in my test code so we can see the results. Feel free to close this if no one else has any ideas related to this.",
