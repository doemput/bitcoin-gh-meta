   "body" : "Local policy is often ~~annoying~~ difficult to change due to how large `AcceptToMempool` is.\r\nThis PR just begins the process of breaking out various functions such that a user could easily remove/test/isolate them if need-be.\r\n\r\nIts WIP for now,  and I'd probably prefer to move the definitions to `policy/*`,  but I figured I'd just submit this PR to gauge concept ACK/NACKs before continuing. \r\n\r\nI'm not tied to any particular detail of this PR,  just wanting to achieve easier configuration of local policy.",
