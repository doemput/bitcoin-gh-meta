No vote needed; everyone knows they have to upgrade by that time. There can still be a miner vote after that 1 year to be sure miners _also_ agree to the change, and know we'll end up with a secure chain after the fork, but that's just belt and suspenders.",

A miner producing an invalid block is, from the perspective of the Bitcoin network, simply not mining at all. This operation is an essential component of the incentive balance which keeps the system working, limiting the potential abuse of high hashpower attacks to reorganization or exclusion of transactions and not arbitrary rule violation, creation of inflation, etc.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is a system which was created to mitigate the harms and costs that result from the reliance on third party trust in other systems of money. It is not a system created to instill ultimate trust in a collection of self-selecting anonymous third parties, but rather one that extends them only the absolute minimum trust necessary, carefully confined and balanced by hard rules and economic incentives.",
