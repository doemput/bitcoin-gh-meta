      "body" : "Thanks for the testing. C++ is memory hungry, absolutely. I don't recommend building on 512MB at all. There was always a recommendation to use at least 1GB but it appears it got lost in f9298cc60e093533ce109aedd7d54d59e87865cd. It may be worded ackwardsly but the gcc tweaking is already *necessary* when compiling with *1 GB* of memory. 512MB is no-chance territory.\r\n\r\nAs I've mentioned repeatedly the best solution, which any embedded developer can tell you, against this frustration is to cross compile from say, an Ubuntu VM on a fast PC. For ARM:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabi # install toolchain\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\ncd depends\r\nmake -j10 HOST=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf NO_QT=1 # NO_WALLET=1 NO_UPNP=1 ...\r\ncd ..\r\n./configure --prefix=$PWD/depends/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf  --enable-glibc-back-compat --enable-reduce-exports LDFLAGS=-static-libstdc++\r\nmake -j10\r\nscp src/bitcoind src/bitcoin-cli src/bitcoin-tx src/test/test_bitcoin $TARGET:\r\n```\r\nAnd voila, you have a `src/bitcoind` and `src/bitcoin-cli` etc to copy to the target.\r\n",

In 24 hours, it is making much more than 144 blocks progress, so it should catch up eventually, however the ETA is still probably a month or two or three out. One can always cheat and copy in the block database from another node, but it is a bit trickier if you are using the `prune=xxx` setting to fit on the SD card. I also have a Pi 2 syncing with the same settings, so I will probably end up cheating when it finishes.\r\n\r\nI have not done Qt with the Pi 1 or 2. The problem is that the heavy SD card accesses for the blockchain stutters the whole system for a couple seconds, so using the desktop at the same time is frustrating. It is near-impossible on a Pi 1 with the 100% single-CPU consumption factor on top of that.  A dedicated, headless pi node appears to be the way to go. After learning the bitcoin-cli commands, it is much more interesting and informative to monitor on the console that way.\r\n\r\nThe flag suggestions were added to the master branch build-unix.md in f9298cc60e093533ce109aedd7d54d59e87865cd, which didn't make it in time for the 0.12 release",
