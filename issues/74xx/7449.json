A part from obsolete implementation, i.e. based on only IPv4 network, I think the intention is possibly also to avoid bad nodes with multiple IP addresses flooding the network. But regardless to that, at least the limitation should be changed per IP address types, so that each IPv4 and IPv6 addresses individually get maximum 8 outbound connections as they are clearly on separate networks.",
