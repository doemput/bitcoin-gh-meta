I put a merge request in ages ago for this very issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6336\r\n\r\nWhat needs to get adjusted is LevelDB's custom makefile (it should have a configure.ac at the very least). Since LevelDB is a Google project, it should be fixed there, but Google isn't really maintaining this project anymore, IIRC. And, since LevelDB was not submoduled into Bitcoin, but copied in and maintained by hand, this is difficult. My merge request addressed the issue of using LevelDB within the context of well-behaved autotools projects like Bitcoin. I would be happy to update the merge request and resubmit.",

The hand-rolled makefile in both google/leveldb and bitcoin/leveldb work pretty well in their own context. It seems to me that someone is tasked with cherry-picking in files from github's bitcoin/leveldb to the bitcoin/src/leveldb directory. This might be similar to the way libsecp256k1works as well, but this is a little off-topic. My suggestion would be to convert bitcoin/leveldb into a \"well-behaved\" autotools project (like libsecp256k1 is now). I would be happy to do this if someone has not committed to this work already. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I would like to suggest that libsecp256k1 and leveldb become git submodules instead of code that needs to be copied into the project by hand (if this in fact what happens). My apologies for the slight derailment. \r\n\r\n",
