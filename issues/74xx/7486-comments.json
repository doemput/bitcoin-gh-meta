      "body" : "@laanwj I upgraded to v0.12.0rc3 on the Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nIt does seem like block validation is going much faster! Especially during catch-up. `getnewaddress` via RPC still takes a long time and will frequently time-out bitcoinrpc. Sometimes I can get it on a streak and get a few successful requests in a row, then more time-outs.\r\n\r\nI am using your revision to jgarzik's bitcoinrpc, I modified these lines:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.12.0rc3/qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/authproxy.py#L110-L127 \r\n...to also catch `socket.timeout` and `httplib.CannotSendRequest`, and print to the console that a timeout has occurred:\r\nhttps://github.com/pinheadmz/ClockBlocker/blob/master/bitcoinrpc.py#L111-L126\r\n\r\nSometimes, the timeout-reload process works and I get a response on the \"first\" retry. However, sometimes the second retry also times out and fails. In this case, the function does NOT retry a second time and execution fails. Any thoughts on how to make this `try/except` infinite retry-until-satisfied?\r\n\r\n",
