For example a user may think that `1.1.1`, as it is accepted, maps to `1.1.1.0/24`. Mapping to 1.1.0.1 is just strange. It should simply reject these.\r\n\r\nAlso, CNetaddr is not supposed to accept a port! but parses this as IPv6 any addr:\r\n\r\n    BOOST_CHECK(CNetAddr(\"250.2.2.2:7777\").ToString() == \"::\");\r\n    BOOST_CHECK(CNetAddr(\"1.1.1.1:1\").ToString() == CNetAddr(\"2.2.2:1\").ToString());\r\n\r\nThese cases too should result an address address that is not valid (`!IsValid()`).\r\n\r\n",
