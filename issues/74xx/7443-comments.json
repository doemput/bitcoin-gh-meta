      "body" : "Well, the reason why the paper was not already in the repository wasn't because of a lack of clarification about its licensing. Clarifying the licensing status of the paper does not merit inclusion of the PDF file into this particular version control repository.\r\n\r\nThe whitepaper you seek to include is already included on bitcoin.org at [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), which seems reasonable considering the website charges itself with extended documentation and historical items. I am not presently convinced that duplication is warranted. License clarification can trivially occur through bitcoin.org, too, which I recommend you go ask them to do regardless of whether your branch is merged.\r\n\r\nPDF files are build artifacts, not source code. Ideally we should avoid committing build artifacts into the repository. Changes to PDF files are difficult to diff, and somewhat meaningless (have you ever hacked around in the PDF file format? I have, sadly....). And even if we did have some expectation of future updates, PDF diffs aren't well tracked by git and its diff tools.\r\n\r\nAnother issue that I would be concerned about is why only one paper and not others? Which papers are going to merit inclusion into the source code repository? It's already an inefficient use of git to include PDF files, so \"it's inefficient\" cannot be used when others request other PDFs to be added after this one. So for this reason if anyone does merge this pull request's branch, then I recommend making it policy to not evaluate papers for inclusion into the repository in the future-- it's the wrong task for a source code repository anyway.\r\n\r\nWe have an increasingly well-maintained source code repository here, focused on delivering source code to developers for developing, building and maintaining Bitcoin Core. ((I notice that a link to the paper is not provided in doc/README.md so that seems like a good alternative to this pull request.))\r\n\r\nBtw, if for whatever reason we were to include the file in the repository, then I would insist on changing the values of `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`.\r\n\r\nAlso, if anyone has the version of bitcoin.pdf from before 427c63b364c6db914cf23072a09ffd53ee078397b7c6ab2d604e12865a982faa it would be interesting to make that public, thanks whoever you aren't.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's entirely necessary to include this in the Bitcoin Core repository, but it's not particularly harmful as long as we commit to not becoming a repository of academic Bitcoin PDFs.....\r\n\r\nI don't really buy the argument that \"bitcoin.org is independent and therefore the paper should be included\"; their independence should be irrelevant in this decision, because if they were deleting their copy of the file, then Bitcoin Core could host the PDF on its website instead.\r\n\r\nAllllsooo..... I don't mean to nitpick, but \"add the white paper back into the bitcoin repository\"-- your link is not to the subversion repository.",

      "body" : "@aantonop I appreciate your situation but we are also not here to satisfy your publishers legal demands :-P If MIT licensing is already established by the wayback machine archives, then surely the problem is already solved regardless of the hosted location. The difficulty in my mind with the web archive is it doesnt actually have a copy of the bitcoin.pdf, so while we can make assumptions, I think we cant say conclusively. It's therefore tricky to make the claim. IANAL. Arent there any other source repository copies of the original repo?\r\n\r\n[I also believe (according to legal advice I have received in the past) that documentation that does not form part of the software (as per the license wording) is not licensed by MIT (which is why special documentation licenses exist), but that's really out of scope for this PR discussion].\r\n\r\nWhile I am not opposed to the PR, I'm very wary of what you are trying to establish using the Bitcoin Core source repository.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you believe that the document is MIT and that the source repository license is good enough, then the bitcoin.org source repository _already establishes MIT license_ https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/blob/master/COPYING and the PDF is located at https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/blob/master/bitcoin.pdf",
