Disk usage (= pruning)\r\n3. Memory usage (= mempool limiting)\r\n4. Network usage (= upload limit)\r\n5. Security (= negative confirmations, Tor)\r\n\r\nReasons for this choice: CPU, disk, memory and network are what will cause the most visible annoyance to the user, so they're first. With money, security is important as well, so that's also bumped.\r\n\r\nThis PR only moves the stuff which I think is understandable to an average user.\r\nIn other words, I didn't touch the more technical stuff which will be difficult to grasp.\r\nIf you want me to sort that as well, feel free to suggest what to move where.\r\n\r\n###  Bonus change\r\nThere was an empty line which I think made no sense, I removed it in 302af5424156584d71d17aa6b211c55a9336.\r\n\r\n##  Open questions\r\nI actually think the potential ~ 60 GB disk usage reduction by pruning is the most important change, not the 5x signature validation CPU usage reduction by libsecp256k1: CPU cycles are continuously \"produced\" by the users machine, but the available disk space is usually fixed. And 60 GB is _a lot_!\r\nBut as I'm biased by having a small SSD in my laptop, I would please like to first request reviewers to voice a vote on whether I should move pruning above libsecp256k1 or not?\r\n",
