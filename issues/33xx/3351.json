   "body" : "Having hundreds of badly developed and programmed Bitcoin applications does not help the cause of Bitcoin. So Bitcoin-QT should conservatively implement all important functions of Bitcoin usage.\r\n\r\nI assume we all agree digital storage is not build for eternity. Bitcoin-QT should definitely support cold storage. I suggest to create Bitcoin addresses NOT storing the private keys in the wallet file or any other digital storage but printing them on paper using QR-codes and OCR-A font. Bitcoin-QT should also have functions to scan paperwallets, read their QR-codes, fall back to optical character recognition and verify the scanned private keys match the Bitcoin addresses.\r\n\r\nThis will prevent average-joes loosing their savings which would have a big negative impact on the reputaion of the Bitcoin system.",
