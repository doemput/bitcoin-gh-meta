   "body" : "Inspired by a Mike Hearn comment on #3276 -- adds a couple of mutex-related routines:\r\n\r\nAssertLockHeld(\"cs_foo\")  :  if compiled -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER, walks the lock stack and makes sure the specified lock is held. If not, a message and the list of locks that ARE held are LogPrintf'ed and then assert(0) is called. Does nothing in normal builds.\r\n\r\nLocksHeld() : -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER-only routine:  returns a human-readable string with all of the locks held. This can be very handy to call from within an interactive debugging session (and it is used by AssertLockHeld).\r\n\r\nI added AssertLockHeld(\"cs_main\") to ProcessBlock as proof-of-concept; if we like this, adding AssertLockHeld calls to more routines can be done in subsequent pulls.\r\n\r\nPS: compiling with -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER in the new autotools-world means a 'make clean' and then something like:\r\n  CXXFLAGS='-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER' ./configure ...\r\n",
