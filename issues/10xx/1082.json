   "body" : "The new algorithm for testnet difficulty after 15 Feb 2012 behaves incorrectly  when \r\npblock->nTime < pindexLast->nTime. As both terms are unsigned, the results of the substraction underflows. The result is greater than  nTargetSpacing*2, which causes the difficulty to be set to the minimum.\r\nI suppose this could be used to mine a lot of blocks in a row at minimum difficulty.\r\n\r\nSee main.cpp line 835: \r\n         \r\n// If the new block's timestamp is more than 2* 10 minutes\r\n// then allow mining of a min-difficulty block.\r\nif (pblock->nTime - pindexLast->nTime > nTargetSpacing*2)\r\n       return nProofOfWorkLimit;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
