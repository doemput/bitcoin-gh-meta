   "body" : "I recently needed to import some private keys into my wallet.\r\n\r\nI knew the addresses had never been used, and so didn't need to rescan the blockchain, but there's no way to import a private key without the client automatically rescanning the whole blockchain.\r\n\r\nThere's also no way to import multiple private keys at once, so to import 5 private keys I had to wait while the client scanned the whole blockchain 5 times over for transactions I knew it wouldn't find anyway.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to either:\r\n\r\n  * import multiple keys with a single importprivkey RPC call, or\r\n  * optionally suppress the blockchain rescan\r\n\r\nOr both.\r\n\r\nI ended up commenting these two lines in rpcdump.cpp to get the job done:\r\n\r\n        // pwalletMain->ScanForWalletTransactions(pindexGenesisBlock, true);\r\n        // pwalletMain->ReacceptWalletTransactions();\r\n\r\nbut would prefer a better solution.",
