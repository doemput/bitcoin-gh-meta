   "body" : "After #1007 and #1010, bitcoin-qt is now taking around 25 seconds to quit cleanly.  It seems to be writing a whole new copy of the blockchain.\r\n\r\nI added code to time the flushes that happen in db.h and saw that it's taking 24s to flush the blockindex now:\r\n\r\n    addr.dat flush\r\n    addr.dat flush done in 127ms\r\n    blkindex.dat refcount=0\r\n    blkindex.dat flush\r\n    UPNP_DeletePortMapping() returned : 0\r\n    ThreadMapPort exiting\r\n    connection timeout\r\n    ThreadOpenConnections exiting\r\n    blkindex.dat flush done in 23975ms\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which commit introduced this slowdown.  rc1 quits in 12s for me.  I'll find out and report back.\r\n\r\nUpdate: 89516bd4e (\"Speed up block downloading\") is the commit that made the shutdown time double.  If I comment out just the line that says:\r\n\r\n    dbenv.set_cachesize(nDbCache / 1024, (nDbCache % 1024)*1048576, 1);\r\n\r\nthen the shutdown speed goes back to 12s.\r\n\r\nTo see this effect more strongly, try running \"bitcoin-qt -dbcache=250\" then quitting immediately.  The window disappears straight away, but the process thrashes the hard drive for over 3 minutes before shutting down.  Maybe that's just the cost of using a disk cache though.",
