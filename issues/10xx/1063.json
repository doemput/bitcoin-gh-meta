The screenshot should give an idea, and this problem also occurs in English, particularly with the tooltips of \"Minimize on close\" and \"Pay transaction fee\" options. Should \\n strings be inserted there? (Bitcoin 0.6.0 running on Ubuntu 10.04)\r\n\r\n![tooltip which may need a line break](http://ompldr.org/vZGIwMQ)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, when you click Settings > Options > Display, \"Display addresses in transaction list\" doesn't have a keyboard shortcut. As all other strings have one, I was wondering whether this one was forgotten (this remark is really secondary, IMHO it didn't make sense to file a separate bug for it).\r\n\r\n",
