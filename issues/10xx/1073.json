I decided to use the new 'dumpprivkey' and 'importprivkey' commands to bring the sub-cent change home.\r\n\r\nAfter running 'importprivkey' and waiting for it to finish, I can see the coin in the 'coincontrol' tab, but it's not showing up in either 'overview' or 'transactions'.\r\n\r\nI shut down and restarted the client and now see it in both 'overview' and 'transactions'.\r\n\r\nIs it to be expected that I should have to restart the client before pre-existing transactions on imported private keys show up?",
