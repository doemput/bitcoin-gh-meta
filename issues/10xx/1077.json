I did a full gitian build and normal builds to make sure it worked, but apparently other environments existed as well (see #1076).\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains a few extra changes to fix all issues I'm currently aware of.\r\n\r\nFor Qt builds, the build.h file is moved to build/build.h. For regular builds, it is moved to obj/build.h. This allows the Qt build to be done in a different directory than the source, and without interfering with other builds.\r\n",
