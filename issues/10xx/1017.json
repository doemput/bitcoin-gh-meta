   "body" : "I've updated coderrr's coincontrol patch #415 so it merges cleanly against v0.6.0, and also updated the coin selection refactor and change reduction changes and unit tests from patch #898.\r\n\r\nThey touch overlapping code, so I've merged them both here.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dooglus/bitcoin/tree/coincontrol-v0.6.0 has just the coincontrol patch, without the other coin selection changes.\r\n\r\nI've improved the coincontrol patch, as follows:\r\n\r\n* it's much faster than coderrr's patch - what used to take over a minute now takes a fraction of a second\r\n* it's reformatted to use 4-space indents like the other bitcoin code\r\n* instead of showing the balance twice for each address, one with 0.0005 taken off, it now shows the total balance of each group\r\n* the groups are sorted so the most valuable group is shown first\r\n* the 'clear all' button on the 'send coins' tab clears the 'send from' input too",
