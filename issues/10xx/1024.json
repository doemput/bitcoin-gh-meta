Passphrase hashed 83218 times with method 0 with other parameters 0x\r\n\r\ni haven't looked at the source but... that 83 thousand times thing looks kinda suspicious. is there a security feature that increases the passphrase hash count every time an incorrect passphrase is entered? is there a buffer or stack overflow thing going on when the hash count gets too high? chirp.",
