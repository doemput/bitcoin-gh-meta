   "body" : "What I try to achieve here:\r\n- harden the URI handling / IPC server (i.e. buffer length checks use of  IMPLEMENT_RANDOMIZE_STACK for the ipcThread)\r\n- log and handle boost interprocess exceptions where possible\r\n- make URI handling more usable / robust on Windows (and not worse on other platforms - needs tests on Linux OSes)\r\n\r\nWhat I achieved (running and verified on Windows):\r\n- it's possible to start the client via URI click, if no message_queue file exists\r\n- if one exists the clicked URI is sent to the queue file, but doesn't start the client (call to try_send() in bitcoin.cpp succeeds and we exit there - currently no check if the client is running - ideas are welcome), the URI is processed after manually starting the client and is not lost\r\n- on Windows it's now possible to use 2 client instances in parallel and the first started one receives clicked URIs, if I close one of the instances the one left will process URIs\r\n- URI length is limited to 255 chars as message queue message size is 256 chars max.\r\n\r\nWhat I could not achieve:\r\n- handle some special cases i.e. a BitcoinURI file get's created by a user and is placed in the boost_interprocess folder -> results in the GUI freeze bug, as the file permissions differ from what boost would set, when creating the mq file -> that causes a boost deadlock (https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6745)\r\n\r\nSome details:\r\nThe message queue is not removed anymore when closing the client, as this causes massive handling problems on Windows with 2 instances and my former approach of stale mq detection. First try is always to open the mq file for a re-use. If this fails a new mq is created.\r\n\r\nThis needs boost 1.49 with a small edit in boost/interprocess/detail/tmp_dir_helpers.hpp see: https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5392#comment:24\r\n\r\nThere is currently no need for any hard monkey-patches like #986.",
