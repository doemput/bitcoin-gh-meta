      "body" : "I just pushed up 4 commits which further improve the cuckoo cache. These commits add epochs/generations for the cache entries which improves the hit rate. Below is a brief description of the changes, for more detail, see the code & code documentation.\r\n\r\nThe first 2 commits are changes to the tests. The first commit simplifies what is checked in the existing tests (it was over specific to that Cache's design). The second adds a new test which fails under the existing code because the code does not prioritize newer entries.\r\n\r\nThe third patch adds generations to cache which work as follows: a bit vector is used to track if the element belongs to the current or prior generation. Once the number of the current generation's non-deleted elements exceeds ~45%, the generation is retired. The previously retired generation is marked deleted. Because the cache deletes lazily, these entries are still present but are more likely to be overwritten than elements in the currently retired generation. Generations are scanned to see if they should be retired using a heuristic of how many inserts would need to occur since the last scan to exceed the generation size.\r\n\r\nThe fourth commit increases the number of hashes used per element from 2 to 8. The benefit of this change is that it permits using a large generation size (e.g., 45%) compared to 2 hashes (30%). A larger generation size is the \"effective size\" of the cache, i.e., new entries stay in the current generation for longer.\r\n\r\nPerformance is markedly better, especially under attack scenarios. @morcos has run several simulations which back up this claim. \r\n\r\nThere is a slight (1-bit per entry) memory overhead to this approach. This does not negatively impact this cache because the trade off is worth it for intelligently deleting older entries. Only one bit is used for simplicity, as we get three represented states (deleted, old, current). Using more generations (lets say, 1 more bit) would allow for more granular freeing of only the oldest quarter and not half per scan. This has advantages, but also an additional memory cost and two generations was sufficient for this use case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a slightly separate note, another side benefit of this cache that I failed to mention when I opened the PR (before these added commits) is that inserts are guaranteed to terminate (in the sigcache currently in master, insert may run forever if GetRand is \"unlucky\").",

      "body" : "Apologies, long rambly response below:\n\nOverall, I think it's a reasonable idea to do this. Modulo is slow. It's not the bottleneck, but it's a low cost way to make this code faster.\n\nThere are a couple of weird things though. You have currently about 2 bits of bookkeeping overhead per entry (one bit for erasure, one bit for epoch). If you're restricting to a power of two size for the main cache memory, you also may as well do some of the following if the user specifies more space: more generations for finer grained generations; additional fee tracking to preferentially evict low fee items; some kind of mempool pointer/index map to evict signatures on mempool eviction. (preface: I don't like this idea, but for sake of discussion) You could also keep a large and a small cache and look up from both; letting you target size = 2^m + 2^n.\n\nAlso, power of two works reasonably well low in the series (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128) but it seems to be kind of uncomfortably that at say a 1GB cache you have to choose between 1 and 2 GB if you want to increase a little bit. Yes, sqrt, but people have fixed memory sizes so it does kind of matter.\n\nMaybe a better inbetween would be to do as (roughly) follows (should work on GCC, clang, and msvc):\n\n```\nDEFAULT_MAX_SIGCACHE_SIZE = 32;\n#ifdef __MSC_VER\n#include <intrin.h>\n#define __builtin_popcount __popcnt\n#endif\nbool fast_mod = __builtin_popcount(size) == 1;\ncompute_hash(E e) {\n    if (fast_mod)\n        // compute hash with masks\n    else\n       // compute hash with mod\n}\n```\n\nand by default not count the bookkeeping bits in the size computation. That way if you pass in a power of two megabytes as the parameter, you get this magic boost in performance, and if you pass in a non power of two if you get what you asked for. The branch shouldn't hurt because it should be easily predicted.\n",

Lock contention on the sig cache is a serious bottleneck to ConnectBlock performance with 8 or more cores.  This patch appears to all but eliminate that contention and leads to a 40% improvement in ConnectBlock time for 16 cores.  It also allows for further performance improvements that would not see any benefit until this bottleneck was removed.\r\n\r\nI have also tested the hit rate performance and it is a significant improvement over the existing sigcache in the event of a spam attack, for a long running node, or in the event of a reorg.\r\n\r\nIn addition to reviewing the included tests, I've also run my own tests and done code review to be sure that there are no false positives.\r\n",

      "body" : "Yes there is a reason.\n\nThe locks aren't actually needed at all how the cache is currently used. All that needs to happen is per thread: at the beginning of a block processing, a memory acquire; at the end of block processing a memory release. Additionally, one more lock must be acquired before block processing by the master to ensure that there are no concurrent writers (from addtomempool) and that master must not release until all slaves release as well. This is much better than the repeated acquire/release of locking/unlocking on every single signature operation.\n\nI have written a version of the code which has this semantics, but some feedback from others felt that it was fragile & prone to someone else breaking that behavior down the line (bad for maintainability). In the interest of keeping that optimization available and not introducing a maintenance hazard, I kept the locking where it was in the \"layer up\".\n",

What you could test is better memory efficiency by allocating smaller caches (2 4 8 16...) and comparing performance to a node running with that size and the old cache. I'd recommend running one node and peering your test nodes exclusively thought that to ensure nodes are getting the same messages for a given time. But if you're hardware limited that will be hard.",

We can't detect actual cache hits v.s. misses with just the `CachingTransactionSignatureChecker::VerifySignature` as it just returns a `bool`. As this would require a bit of restructuring, it's probably easiest review that as a separate PR, if needed.",
