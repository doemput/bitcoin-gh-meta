Using the transaction in my nodes memory and there related timestamps. Ensure that this **new block** didn't accept any older TX that shouldn't be there.\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n*Tell us what should happen:*\r\nThe block shouldn't be accepted as it's malicious, regarding \"double - spending.\"\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n*Tell us what happens instead*\r\nThe Block gets accepted \"as is.\" Even if the current node(your node) has the original and first TX.\r\n\r\nProposal: Validate timestamps of all transactions in a given block before accepting the block.",
