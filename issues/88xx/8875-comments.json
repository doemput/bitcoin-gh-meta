Before DEB-based becomes the most popular, Red Hat makes a backwards compability for their system. I mean LSB, the Linux Standard Base. So the true way is making builds for previous CentOS version for cover the maximum range. What Digia does, so only one Qt5 build works in a few CentOS releases, as well as in other Linux distributions. 99% of Linuxes has LSB compability, including Debian.\r\n\r\nIf you build binaries in a DEB-based build farm, it will not give full backward compability, like LSB. So we see Steam Runtime and Snap packages.",

      "body" : "Some companies are dedicated to supporting old versions of software, nothing wrong with that. The question here is whether that maintenance and testing burden should fall to us as developers of the upstream code. Someone could always (say) argue **I want this to compile on my DOS machine with Turbo C++ 3.0!** Well if you want that, it's up to you to make and maintain a patch-set. There is a point at which too many fallbacks and workarounds and conditional features accumulate that it isn't realistic to support a certain dependency library version anymore.\r\n\r\nThough in the specific case of boost we can stick with 1.47.0 for a while. I'm not aware of any terrible issues, the worst ones were with Boost Filesystem v1/2.  In addition to the general stuff @fanquake mentions in the OP there's only three post-1.47 conditionals:\r\n```\r\nsrc/scheduler.cpp:#if BOOST_VERSION < 105000\r\nsrc/scheduler.cpp:#if BOOST_VERSION < 105000\r\nsrc/util.cpp:#if BOOST_VERSION >= 105600\r\n```\r\nThe first two have to do with time handling, which will be changed to std::chrono soon anyway (#9566). The latter has to do with detecting \"hyperthread\" cores or not for -par, which is a bit unfortunate but not critical.\r\n\r\nSo I think we can stop the discussion about boost versions here. Maybe we can even postpone bumping the minimum boost version until we remove the boost dependency completely.",
