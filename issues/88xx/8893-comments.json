Hence if your node is wrong it would simply not be able to connect to any other node. Effectively eliminating itself. Using a cluster of approved ntp-servers could then form part of node validation on the network. I understand that some countries does have high latency and that some idea/s like this is the only feasible manner to address the this issue. Or some how \"Lock\" the transaction but this would require all miners to accept this. Any miner could still generate blocks as is and would still be accepted.
