   "body" : "(follow-up to #8780)\n\nThere have been some requests for a client-side `getinfo` and this is my PoC of how to do it. The high-level idea is to have one command to gather and show various information and statistics about a `bitcoind` in one go.\n\nThis could be used as an opportunity to make `getinfo` better, it doesn't have to have exactly the same fields as the original RPC, e.g. a `chain` instead of `testnet` flag would make sense (but it is currently the same, according to this table: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8455#issuecomment-250468383). \n\nIf this is considered a good idea some of the logic could be moved up to rpcclient.cpp and used in the GUI console as well.\n### Implementation\n\nThis adds the infrastructure `BaseRequestHandler` class that takes care of converting bitcoin-cli arguments into a JSON-RPC request object, and converting the reply into a JSON object that can be shown as result.\n\nThis is subsequently used to handle the `-getinfo` option, which sends a JSON-RPC batch request to the RPC server with `[\"getnetworkinfo\", \"getblockchaininfo\", \"getwalletinfo\"]`, and after reply combines the result into what looks like a `getinfo` result.\n",
