   "body" : "Built on #8871, this removes the fetch logic from INV message processing. it is rare that we care strongly about the speed of fetch in case we receive an INV, plus we found that code which did not have knowledge of the associated tip when requesting was more fragile in the context of segwit activation. Finally, this removes the one place we MarkBlockAsInFlight (ie will forcibly store the block on disk in AcceptBlock) without having seen the header first.\n",
