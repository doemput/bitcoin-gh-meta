Currently looking for feedback on concept and approach.**\r\n\r\nThis continues the work of #7965. This PR, along with #10583, #10579, #10571, #8843 and one more PR to split `createmultisig`, would remove the remaining dependencies from libbitcoin_server.a on libbitcoin_wallet.a.\r\n\r\nI've used the same `boost::signal` approach that is used in the validationinterface. bitcoind.cpp and qt/bitcoin.cpp register wallet initialization/destruction callbacks as slots in a `WalletInitInterface`, and init.cpp emits those signals during startup/shutdown. This could potentially be extended in future to allow multiple wallets or other modules to register.\r\n\r\nTo create the interface, I've just translated all the old init.cpp wallet function calls into signals. I've not done any thinking about whether it makes sense to change that interface by combining/splitting those calls. This is a purely internal interface, so there's no problem in changing it later.",
