Enter a wallet address and amount to transfer, minus the advertised fee\r\n2. Enter your key, watch the error result\r\n3. The \"fee\" keeps changing and therefore the transaction cannot be completed\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nTell us what should happen\r\n\r\nThe calculation UI should be a better UX where the fee and transfer amount (ie: your wallet contents) should be calculated on the fly, ready to go.   The UI doesn't allow the fee to be copied-and-pasted (perhaps an oversight), where your balance can.  So multiple issues in this UI that need fixing.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nTell us what happens instead\r\n\r\nEach time I go to transfer an amount, the \"fee\" stays the same, but the error window after continues to change in small amounts.  For example the \"fee\" on the UI is static at 0.0002xxx but the error window complains about the amount exceeding minus the fee 0.0003xxx.  This is very problematic.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots.\r\nIf the issue is related to the GUI, screenshots can be added to this issue via drag & drop.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nList the version number/commit ID, and if it is an official binary, self compiled or a distribution package such as PPA.\r\n\r\n v0.14.2 (64-bit)\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: OSX Sierra\r\n- CPU:\r\n- RAM: 32GB\r\n- Disk size: 1TB\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): SDD\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\nThis is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred.\r\n",
