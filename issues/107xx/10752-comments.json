We know `primitives/` is relative to the source root of the repository, so it doesn't really need to look anywhere else. Especially not if it is already in `primitives/`, e.g. \r\n- when `primitives/block.h` includes `\"primitives/transaction.h\"`, then it makes it look in `src/primitives/primitives`\r\n- when `src/wallet/feebumper.h` includes `\"primitives/transaction.h\"`, it makes it look in `src/wallet/primitives`!\r\n\r\nSo with regard to unambiguity, this is a change for the worse.",
