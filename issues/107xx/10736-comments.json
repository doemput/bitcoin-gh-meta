Maybe long them though, it might be easier if there was a configuration setting or flag for storing all of the leveldb stuff on an internal drive and/or the blockchain blocks folder on an external drive.  As I mentioned in the pull request, this may not be the best way for these instructions to reach their intended audience so please feel free to redirect me.  Thanks!",
