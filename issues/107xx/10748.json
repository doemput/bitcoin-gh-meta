   "body" : "This is very much a matter of personal taste, but I think this changeset makes command line arguments help text code clearer.\r\n\r\nA bunch of changes:\r\n\r\n- order groupings alphabetically\r\n- order arguments alphabetically within groupings\r\n- make `HelpMessageOpt()` responsible for whether to print debug arguments. This is done by passing a `HELP_MESSAGE_FILTER`, which will result in the help text being printed only if `-debug-help` is set\r\n- move server-specific option into bitcoind.cpp, and remove the `mode` argument from `HelpMessage()`\r\n- move the calls to `GetWalletHelpString()` into bitcoind.cpp and qt (removes one dependency on bitcoin_wallet from bitcoin_server).\r\n\r\nthe help message filter is implemented as a bitfield, so could be updated to include other filters (eg `HELP_MESSAGE_FILTER_NOT_WIN32`) and remove the preprocessor conditionals from `HelpMessage()`",
