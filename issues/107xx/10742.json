   "body" : "Rationale (from Bjarne Stroustrup's [\"C++11 FAQ\"](http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html#enum)):\r\n\r\n> \r\n> The enum classes (\"new enums\", \"strong enums\") address three problems with traditional C++ enumerations:\r\n> \r\n> * conventional enums implicitly convert to int, causing errors when someone does not want an enumeration to act as an integer.\r\n> * conventional enums export their enumerators to the surrounding scope, causing name clashes.\r\n> * the underlying type of an enum cannot be specified, causing confusion, compatibility problems, and makes forward declaration impossible.\r\n>\r\n> The new enums are \"enum class\" because they combine aspects of traditional enumerations (names values) with aspects of classes (scoped members and absence of conversions).",
