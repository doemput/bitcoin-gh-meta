   "body" : "**Work in progress**\r\n\r\nAdds `openwallet` and `closewallet` RPCs. This allows wallets to be loaded and unloaded dynamically during runtime without having to stop-start the node with new `-wallet` params.\r\n\r\nMain motivation for this was the fact that several wallet parameters are actions for individual wallet load/creation, rather than properties of the wallet component. Examples are `-salvagewallet`, `-rescan`, `-usehd` and `-upgradewallet`. Continuing with that config/loading model is difficult in a multi-wallet world - how can users run those actions on individual wallets when loading multiple wallets? This PR offers a solution: individual wallets can be loaded at run-time, and RPC parameters can be passed in to carry out the various wallet-loading actions. Note that none of those load actions are yet implemented in this PR, but can easily be added.\r\n\r\nThe `openwallet` RPC also takes a passphrase argument, so the wallet can be unlocked on opening. This is a solution to some of the edge-cases in #10882 (where we could make a wallet unusable if its best block was behind the tip).\r\n\r\nIncludes functional test.\r\n\r\n**This is a work in progress**\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is not thread-safe since one RPC thread could delete a wallet while another RPC thread is using the wallet.",
