That is quite impressive considering that the Swift project has had [218 merged typo fix PRs]( https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20typos%20) already. Prior to the run with your tool I believed the Swift repo to be at near zero typos (despite having 1.8 million lines of text in the repo) :-)\r\n\r\nThis can be compared to 14 typos in the Bitcoin project which has 400 000 lines of text in the repo (as measured by `git grep \"\" | wc -l`).\r\n\r\nTo compare:\r\n* Your tool found one typo per 29 000 lines of text in the Bitcoin repo (400000/14)\r\n* Your tool found one typo per 150 000 lines of text in the Swift repo (1800000/12)",
