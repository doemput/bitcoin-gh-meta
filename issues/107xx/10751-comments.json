There is no way the -cli can access the server implementation files (`rpc/misc.cpp` etc). which contain the dispatch tables.\r\n\r\nAn old idea is to remove all command-specific knowledge from the cli and instead request a JSON document from the server that describes the interface. This, in combination with smart caching to prevent extra roundtrips, could work.\r\n",
