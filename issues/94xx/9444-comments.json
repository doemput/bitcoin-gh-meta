      "body" : "@benzmuircroft Thanks for the suggestion though - bitcoin is a complex thing, so I know from experience, it can be difficult to tell the difference between thinking we've found something missed, vs. not fulling understanding the requirements. Your suggestion is more in-line with what an \"SPV\" node does, which requires a level of trust with the nodes providing the results of the queries you mention. #9076 may be a step in the direction of what you are proposing.",
