      "body" : "@sipa Thanks - I was just about to look into coding something similar so you have saved me the job. In the similar way that GetBoolArg() works, I wondered if perhaps we could have a boolean check for whether various debug are set, or perhaps even a scenario where we can say log this if debug=tx OR debug=mempool is set since I have some debug lines from mempool and tx functions merged, perhaps something like `LogPrint(\"mempool\", \"tx\", \"received tx %s AcceptedToMemPool bla bla\", hash.ToString())`, or `LogPrint(\"mempool|tx\", \"received tx %s AcceptedToMemPool bla bla\", hash.ToString())`\r\n\r\nLooking at the code it looks like the boolean function exists already, but the 2nd part (the \"this category or that category\" would still be nice).",
