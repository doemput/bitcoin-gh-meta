It was primarily noticing that `(!tx.HasWitness() && !state.CorruptionPossible())` is bring run against txs we already have in the mempool that made me wonder if there was a logic oversight here, but perhaps the overhead from running this checks again is not significant.\r\n\r\nI am not aware yet of why we would want to relay txs (possibly multiple times) to whitelisted nodes that we already have in our mempool though - is this requirement documented somewhere please?",
