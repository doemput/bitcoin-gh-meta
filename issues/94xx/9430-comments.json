I told you yesterday: you fail to show that your Tor SOCKS5 proxy is usable without restrictions to any other client that uses the same settings as bitcoind. \r\n\r\nI'm running 0.13 with Tor SOCKS5 proxy (Tor alpha channel) right now, no issues. \r\n\r\n",

If you were to use the wrong port as SOCKS5 proxy, you'd get unexpected responses just like here.\r\n\r\nThere are many users of Bitcoin Core + Tor so everything suggests a local configuration issue on your end.",
