   "body" : "A proposed new feature / RPC call.\r\n\r\nA way to get IP addresses of other bitcoin nodes known to your node via RPC.\r\n\r\nThis would be useful for bitcoin wallets that unlink the source IP address from a transaction by connecting through tor to any bitcoin node out there for a short time. Examples of projects that might do this are JoinMarket (https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket/pull/662), laanwj's submit-tx tool or anything else built on top of Bitcoin Core such as Armory.\r\n\r\nRight now these projects might use the DNS seeds instead, which are much less decentralized and which could be shut down to stop the tor-broadcast feature working.\r\n\r\nI think this new call would be exactly the same as the `getaddr` command from the p2p protocol but as an RPC instead.",
