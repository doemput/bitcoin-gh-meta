   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\nThe problem is, the error message: 'ERROR: Error reading proxy response' in the debug.log file.\r\nI wanted to simply run bitcoin over TOR. So in the bitcoin.conf file i had the following lines:\r\nbind=127.0.0.1\r\nport=8333\r\nupnp=0\r\nproxy=127.0.0.1:9050\r\n\r\nThen i started bitcoind in terminal, i monitored the debug.log file and i saw that error message described above every minute or so while i was getting a new 'update tip' block.\r\n\r\nTo test if TOR was really working, i stopped the TOR service and i immediately got countless errors:\r\nconnect() to 127.0.0.1:9050 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)\r\nconnect() to 127.0.0.1:9050 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)\r\nconnect() to 127.0.0.1:9050 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)\r\n\r\nSo i realized that TOR was working, yet the original unknown error of:\r\n'ERROR: Error reading proxy response'  occurred.\r\n\r\nPlease note: my intention was not to use a hidden tor service.\r\nMy intention was to simply torify outgoing connections as described in the first step here:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md#1-run-bitcoin-behind-a-tor-proxy\r\nand here:\r\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=623868.0\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nThe expected behaviour should have been that bitcoin would run over tor without a proxy error while tor is actually working.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin   (https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin)\r\nsudo apt-get install bitcoind\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): SSD\r\n\r\nIf there should be some other type of config that i am missing in bitcoin.conf please let me know.",
