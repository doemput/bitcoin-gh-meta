   "body" : "-checklevel gets a new meaning:\r\n0: verify blocks can be read from disk (like before)\r\n1: verify (contextless) block validity (like before)\r\n2: verify undo data can be read and matches checksums\r\n3: verify coin database is consistent with the last few blocks (close to level 6 before)\r\n4: verify all validity rules of the last few blocks (including signature checks)\r\n\r\nLevel 3 is the new default, as it's reasonably fast. As levels 3 and 4 are implemented using an in-memory rollback of the database, they are limited to as many blocks as possible without exceeding the limits set by -dbcache. The default of -dbcache=25 allows for some 150-200 blocks to be rolled back.\r\n\r\nIn case an error is found, the application quits with a message instructing the user to restart with -reindex. Better instructions, and automatic recovery (when possible) or automatic reindexing are left as future work.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this also changes the on-disk format of undo data (adding a checksum), as the correctness of the coindb checks depends on having intact undo data.",
