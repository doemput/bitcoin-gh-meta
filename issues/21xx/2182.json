But do NOT\r\nratelimit transactions added to the memory pool:\r\n  - because of blockchain reorgs\r\n  - stored in the wallet and added at startup\r\n  - sent from the GUI or one of the send* RPC commands (CWallet::CommitTransaction)\r\n\r\nThe limit-free-transactions code really should be a method on CNode, with\r\ncounters per-peer. But that is a bigger change for another day.",
