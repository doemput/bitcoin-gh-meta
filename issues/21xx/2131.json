   "body" : "To fix a minor malleability found by Sergio Lerner (reported here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8392.msg1245898#msg1245898)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if (R,S) is a valid ECDSA signature for a given message and public key, (R,-S) is also valid. Modulo N (the order of the secp256k1 curve), this means that both (R,S) and (R,N-S) are valid. Given that N is odd, S and N-S have a different lowest bit. We solve the problem by forcing signatures to have an even S, excluding one of the alternatives.\r\n\r\nThis pull request just changes the signing code to always produce even S values, and adds a verification mode to check it. This code is not enabled anywhere yet. Existing tests in key_tests.cpp verify that the produced signatures are still valid.",
