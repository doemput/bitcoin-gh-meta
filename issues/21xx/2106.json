   "body" : "Several upgrades, each necessary to fix problem with the previous one. They could be separated, but at least this combination builds and works. It certainly needs a lot of testing, but I want to give it some exposure:\r\n * Upgrade to LevelDB 1.7\r\n * Switch to a native Windows LevelDB port (not anymore via Boost)\r\n * Switch to MinGW-w64 (32-bit mode) for Windows builds, as the new Windows port required a more recent GCC/environment than provided by MinGW32.\r\n * Switch to a 32-bit Precise image for Windows builds (which provides MinGW-w64 with GCC 4.6.3).\r\n * Switch to Boost 1.52, as Boost 1.50's thread library doesn't build on MinGW-w64.\r\n\r\n",
