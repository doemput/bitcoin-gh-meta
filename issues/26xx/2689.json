   "body" : "For Windows builds, only the setup executable is signed. On Windows, it's customary for publishers to sign both the setup and binaries. I understand signing the executable doesn't increase tamper resistance during download. However, signing the run-time executable provides the following advantages:\r\n\r\n* any UAC dialog box will show Bitcoin Foundation as the publisher\r\n* it allows users who don't use the setup executable to verify the program's authenticity\r\n* the executable can later be verified for any tampering (especially when running across USB drives)",
