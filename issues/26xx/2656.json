A solution to this is to allow the client to use a remote server.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the use of the bitcoin-qt client on an irregular basis without needing to resync everytime. This would also allow the use of multiple clients, a client on the laptop and another on the phone, with them all connected to the same backend.",
