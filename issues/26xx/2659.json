As I was not sure what was happening, I decided to close the program and reopen it rescanning the blockchain to see how the client will behave under this conditions (Used the command \"bitcoin-qt.exe -testnet -txindex -reindex\" ). Well, the gui become too unresponsive (about 10 seconds frozen and then processed the Gui Messages and become unresponsive again for another 10 seconds), but after rescanning about 20000 blocks the above message appear. I closed the program and reopened with the command  \"bitcoin-qt.exe -testnet\" the rescan continued from where it stoped when the crashes happened. But after another 20000 blocks the message appeared again. Well, this message appeared more two times (when was about 12000 and about 11000 blocks left), after this all went well and the reindex finished without more crashes. So, any Ideas why this happenend?\r\n\r\nI'm using Windows XP SP3, intel core 2 duo and 4 GB of memory and bitcoin 0.8.1.\r\n\r\nRegards",
