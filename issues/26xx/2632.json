   "body" : "Matt Corallo's bitcoind/bitcoinj comparison tool relies on a patch that sets difficulty to zero, thus ensuring blocks can be found instantly without any delay. It also drops the subsidy halving interval so that can be tested and makes a few other tweaks.\r\n\r\nThis series of patches creates a new CChainParams abstraction that hides various things that vary between main, test and regression test networks. It then adds a regtest mode triggered by the -regtest flag that disables external connections and uses the \"insta-block\" rule set. Also, the miner thread will shut down once it finds a block, meaning you can generate a single block from the command line on demand by running\r\n\r\n./bitcoind -regtest setgenerate true\r\n\r\nThis change is incomplete - some things like DNS seeds, checkpoints and difficulty transition formulas aren't refactored out yet. However I wanted to get feedback on the approach before continuing, and the current code is useful even though there's still more refactoring to go.\r\n\r\nSigned off by: Matt Corallo",
