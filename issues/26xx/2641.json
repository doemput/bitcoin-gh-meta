Where's the blocks?\r\n\r\nI get a new empty datadir/testnet3 subdirectory.\r\n\r\nbitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=c:\\testnet (with a testnet=1 bitcoin.conf file\r\noption in that directory) stored wallet/blocks/chainstate in the root\r\nwith previous versions. Now the root datadir data is ignored (except the\r\nconfig file) and a new hierarchy was created in subdirectory\r\n[b]/testnet3[/b].\r\n\r\nSo what's happening?\r\n\r\nThis looks to be done by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2605\r\n... after searching the code for the change and then finding the commit.\r\n\r\n1 day from opened to committed, released six days later... no changelog.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe datadir previously worked as I expected with both bitcoin-qt and\r\nbitcoind interacting with no problems, when simply specifying a\r\ncommand-line datadir, so I don't see the bug.\r\n\r\nI can see how the previous behavior might be dangerous if the config\r\nfile was removed. I just did that, and there's a cool freakout where my\r\ntestnet wallet balance looks like real BTC and Bitcoin tries to reorg\r\n67662 blocks starting from the genesis block. After receiving real block\r\n73354 per debug log, a nice unrecoverable crash:\r\n\r\n\"Assertion failed!\"\r\nFile: src/main.cpp Line 1745\r\nExpression: pfork != NULL\r\n\r\n\r\nThis needs to be added to the changelog, since dropping in this binary\r\nwill break testnet stuff if anybody is using Bitcoin this way for their\r\ntestnet faucet, etc:\r\n\r\n\" * testnet data now stored in testnet3 subdirectory, enforced even when\r\nspecifying datadir on command line (manually move your data first)\"",
