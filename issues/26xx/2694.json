(This directive might only be insertable if approved by N-of-M prior declared guardian keys. The directive might involve a one-time fee, after which the old address is null and the new address replaces it in perpetuity, or might include a declared service fee that can be deducted to miners on each future use of the new-key to draw on dead-key outputs.)\r\n",
