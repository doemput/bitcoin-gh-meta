   "body" : "direct connectivity to bitcoind is often problematic due to NAT/firewalls/etc, and onion routing is slow and overly complex (and not very private any longer anyway). Zerotier routing seems to be much faster by comparison and bypasses many networking issues. They provide a public network where anyone can join, using an IP address range which exists but which is not accessible from the internet directly.\n\nI would like to submit a pull to make it easier to use zerotier earth IP addresses, but in order for the seeders to identify nodes on these addresses as up bitcoin needs to distinguish between regular IP addresses and zerotier networks. Is there a style standard for doing this? \n",
