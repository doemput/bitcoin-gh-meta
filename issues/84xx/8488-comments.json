That's just too much of a foot-shooting gun, as well as is easy to use in the wrong way - people will use it to generate one-shot keys, by generating a key then removing it, but this can't provide any guarantee at all.\r\n\r\nAnd with HD wallets it makes no sense anyhow.\r\n\r\n'hiding' addresses or 'neutering' keys, however, is fine. So is forgetting watchonly keys.\r\n",
