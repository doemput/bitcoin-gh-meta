   "body" : "Based on #8451.\r\n\r\nThis is a code change that was suggested early on, but not included in the segwit PR to not invalidate review. It turns out to be simpler than what I had expected, and actually shortens the code.\r\n\r\nInstead of a structure where all `CTransaction`'s witness data was encapsulated under `CTransaction::wit`, it is now inlined inside `CTransaction::vin[x]`. This also reduces memory usage for witness-bearing transactions (as no separate vector for all `CTxInWitness`es is needed) and serialization/deserialization time as a result. For non-witness transactions with more than 1 input, it increases memory usage.\r\n\r\nI think it's neat that it changes the verbose and often-repeated `tx.wit.vtxinwit.size() > i ? &tx.wit.vtxinwit[i].scriptWitness : NULL` pattern in `VerifyScript` calls to just `&tx.vin[i].scriptWitness`.\r\n\r\nThis should have no effect on behaviour.",
