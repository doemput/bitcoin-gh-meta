   "body" : "If one is not interested in the history (metadata) of a transaction \"importaddress\" and \"importprivkey\" don't require a pruned wallet to download the whole blockchain again (the utxo set is enough). So it's absolutely vital that this option is available in bitcoin core because it means a pruned blockchain (of only a few GB) becomes independent of the wallet and can be downloaded by anyone possibly only checking the pruned blockchain randomly for a percentage of blocks. That is: checking the picture under \"Simplified Payment Verification\" in the Bitcoin white paper for some random blocks and maybe checking it also for each receiving transaction or imported address. It could also be much faster to check all blocks of a pruned blockchain instead of creating it from the raw blocks.These  procedures are  possibly essential for scaling bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAs I have checked, it is possible in pruned mode to import addresses but they will only show new incoming transactions not the last UTXO value. \r\n\r\nWhen this feature is available, it becomes possible in pruned mode to import the private keys of a paper wallet into a hot wallet.\r\n\r\nI have first discussed this issue with experts on Reddit here: https://redd.it/4w9s6q\r\n",
