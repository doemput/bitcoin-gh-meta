This is using the Windows 64bit binaries.\r\nI've verified upnp is working and I can be connected to externally.\r\nI've attempted to eject slow peers and the entire list to get new ones. I've also deleted my peers.dat to get it regenerated.\r\nI've reindexed.\r\nThe debug log file doesn't report anything negative and generally only includes notifications of peers connecting.\r\nI have peers that provide the services NETWORK and BLOOM.\r\nIs there anything else I can try?",
