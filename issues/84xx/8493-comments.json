For convenience, one can see the changes without the moveonly in: https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/compare/0.12.99-consensus-moveonly-header...jtimon:0.13-consensus-header\r\n\r\nAs discussed:\r\n\r\n- consensus/params.h is no longer included by script/bitcoinconsensus.h: bitcoinconsensus_create_consensus_parameters and bitcoinconsensus_destroy_consensus_parameters are created instead.\r\n\r\n- This also saves all the preparations for using a 32 byte array instead of a uint256 in Consensus::Params since its only going to be exposed in the create function: no need to disrupt any of the 3 hashes in Consensus::Params nor the convenience method. Quite a few diffs have been saved here, thanks again.\r\n\r\nThe TODOs will be updated at the end of the OP, but here's the current summary:\r\n\r\n- finish implementing bitcoinconsensus_create_consensus_parameters (and remove whatever is not needed anymore from the base_blob<> preparations).\r\n\r\n- The interface for CBlockIndex (```const BlockIndexInterface* iBlockIndex```) could be hidden in libconsensus using the same create/destroy blockindexInterfaceTrick, even if some of the parameters are going to be function pointers. Or we could offer both and see what happens...discussion welcomed here, but allowing BlockIndexInterface* to be passed as void* it's in the todo list whether for necessary or just to see how it looks like.\r\n\r\n- new warnings\r\n",
