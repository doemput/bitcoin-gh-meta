Determining the root cause of the IPv6 issue and how to remove it occupied a large amount of our engineering time yesterday, so we hope to be able to begin shipping other fixes more frequently over the coming days.\r\nIf you're seeing issues and need assistance, please email support@travis-ci.com",
