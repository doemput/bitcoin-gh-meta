It is not a guarantee that the value cannot be modified at all.\r\n\r\nConsider the example at the bottom of http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/const_cast; a const reference (`cref_i`) is taken of a non-const value (`i`); then it is modified through the non-const reference `const_cast<int&>(cref_i)`, and accessed through the const reference `cref_i`. If your reasoning was correct, this example would be undefined. The issue that this PR *does* fix is lower down in the same example: `j` is a const value, and as such no non-const aliases exist, and const casting it to non-const is therefore illegal.",
