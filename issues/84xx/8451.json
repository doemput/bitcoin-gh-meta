   "body" : "As explained on https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/967, using const member fields in CTransaction (or any deserializable class) is not well defined in C++, as such fields should only ever be assigned at construction time.\r\n\r\nI believe we can get rid of them. Their purpose was making sure that CTransaction was not used in places where mutable fields were required, but now that CMutableTransaction is well-established that requirement is not so strong anymore.\r\n\r\nLonger term, I'd prefer to see better encapsulation of CTransaction (which could also introduce better internal representation of the data, without a gazillion allocations) and improvements to the serialization framework so that we can construct objects by deserializing... but I think that's further out than a fix for this.\r\n\r\nSo at a higher level, this changes CTransaction from \"immutable transaction data\" to \"transaction data with cached hashes\". I've added a small comment about this as well.\r\n\r\nPing @daira @ebfull.\r\n",
