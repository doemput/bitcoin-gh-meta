   "body" : "nLastBlockFile is used to determine which block file new blocks are written to.  During a reindex, it could previously hop around if the tip of the active chain was not always in the highest numbered block file encountered so far.\r\n\r\nThere is not a known problem with the existing behavior, but I think the semantics of having nLastBlockFile actually refer to the highest number file and not just the one in which the latest tip was found during a reindex makes sense.  The difference in behavior is that during a reindex with corrupted or out of order data:\r\n- in the old code, nLastBlockFile will point to the block file with the last valid block (chainActive.Tip())\r\n- after this pull, nLastBlockFile will point to the highest numbered block file which contains a valid block (on chainActive).\r\nFuture block writes will start looking at nLastBlockFile and increment it until they find a block file with unused space enough for the write.\r\n\r\n@sipa, I don't know if you think its worth the review time to verify this doesn't mess anything up.  But I find the logic confusing as is.",
