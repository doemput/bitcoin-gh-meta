IMHO, the default dbcache size is too small.  I'm with @TheBlueMatt that it seems bad to randomly wipe it unless we think that'll be very rare.\r\n\r\nI'd actually argue we might not even need to remove cache entries that are due to evicted tx's, because there is a relay cost that is paid to create those.",

      "body" : "I did some benchmarking on this pull.  I built it on top of all the other improvements in #6976 except I tried it with and without the hot cache.  It caused a significant performance boost to ConnectBlock.  Unfortunately on my test days, 10/6 and 10/7 and using 100 M mempool and 200 M dbcache, the total cpu time shot up by over 10%.   This seems to be entirely due to the 15kb very low fee transaction spam and increased time to reject these txs.  I did not break down where the time was spent, but my guess is that it is not all in the uncaching code and that part of the problem is that these large txs often spent from the same prev hashes.  So by uncaching them we cause more time to be spent just calculating the fee of new txs before we can reject them.  \r\nIt also had the desired effect of reducing cache size, and reduced cache flushes from 38 to 16 over the 2 days.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the results.  I haven't fully reviewed the code yet, but I think this might be a performance hit we could tolerate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode | Avg time for tx rejected by ATMP (ms) | Avg time to connect block (ms)\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nbaseline (#6976 except #6936) | 1.7 | 134\r\nbaseline + #6936 | 1.7 | 128\r\nbaseline + this PR | 2.9 | 109\r\nbaseline + this PR + #6936 | 2.9 | 104\r\n\r\n\r\n",
