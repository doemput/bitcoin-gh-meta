If it cannot because it doesn't find any, or because the Tor instance is broken, or because the clock is skewed, or whatever, so be it. onlynet=tor is not on by default and it has a clear name, so whoever is using it knows what he's doing. \r\n\r\n@laanwj I am running 3 onlynet=tor full nodes for quite some time, and they have never connected to a clearnet peer as far as I was able to see. I use addnode=foo.onion in bitcoin.conf along with onlynet=tor so I am guessing that is why it has no problems bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Tor only supports resolving anonymously DNS A records at Exit node end. If it supported looking up of more types of records and validating DNSSEC signatures, we could add hostnames of onion peers in TXT records to the main hardocded clearnet (normal DNS) seed nodes and an onlynet=tor node would just take the onion hostnames from there and connect to them without actually establishing connections to the clearnet seed nodes. There is a proposal for this so this shouldn't happen too far way in the future, hopefully. Let me know if my onion nodes can help in any way.",
