   "body" : "After starting bitcoin as a daemon it takes about 1 GB of memory from the 3 GB my VPS has available.\r\nBut some 3 hours later is has occupied an additional 1 GB and this continues creeping down until only hardly anything has been left available.\r\nFive hours after start: only 59MB left of initial free 2 GB. \r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\nVPS with 64 bit hardware and 32 bit Debian, compiler gcc 4.9.3\r\nRecent libboost and libevent. No GUI as it runs on a Virtual Private Server.\r\nIncludes one wallet. Is limited to 50 external connections.\r\nHome compiled bitcoin-master (12/10/2015, v 119900, protocol v 70011).\r\nHave also tried the current 32 bit binary release. Same effect.\r\nIs current in having the database with blocks (379012 15/10/2015).\r\n\r\nHave seen reports in this sense before but it was discarded as an effect of getting the block database current. But that cannot be it. Are others seeing this and what can be done?",
