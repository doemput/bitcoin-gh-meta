      "body" : "That's interesting.\r\nLooks like something weird with regard to IPv4/IPv6 address parsing is going on.\r\nCNetAddr constructor uses `LookupHost(fAllowLookup=false)` internally, which uses `getaddrinfo`. Which outsources to the OS. I suppose something is wrong there. I think the most straightforward way to debug this would be to sprinkle some debug print statements over `LookupIntern`, to see what goes in and comes out...\r\n",
