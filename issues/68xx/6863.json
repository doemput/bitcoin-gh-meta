   "body" : "Update the unittest that is meant to catch a transaction that is invalid because it has a null input.  The old test failed not because of that but because it was considered a coinbase with too large script.  This is already checked with a different test, though.\r\n\r\nThe new test is *not* a coinbase since it has two inputs, but one of them is null.  This really checks the corresponding code path in `CheckTransaction`.  If this check is disabled there in `main.cpp`, the old unittest still succeeded.  It does no longer succeed with this patch.",
