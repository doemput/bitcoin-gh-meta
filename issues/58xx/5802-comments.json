Even though `\"\"` appears to be the default label, you probably have at least one with a different label.\r\n\r\n`getbalance` and `getbalance \"*\" 0` should return the same result.\r\n`getbalance \"*\"` should return the sum of unspent outputs, but with at least one confirmation.",

Right now everything looks sane, but only because I have no unconfirmed funds/change.",
