I don't understand why it was removed in the first place, and didn't get an answer on IRC when I inquired a week ago. But since the commit message states \"no-one cares about\" the option, it seems reasonable to restore it so long as it is cared about.\r\n\r\nNote: This needs adapting if #5833 gets merged first. git will NOT detect the conflict.",
