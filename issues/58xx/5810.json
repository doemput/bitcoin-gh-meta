Headers were fixed up as necessary, and I added the bitcoin-config.h include in pagelocker.cpp in case it was picked up from elsewhere before.\r\n\r\nPagelocker is only used for sensitive info, so don't require it for things that just want zero-after-free. In particular, this un-tethers streams from boost and global app-state.",
