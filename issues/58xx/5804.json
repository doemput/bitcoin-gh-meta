   "body" : "Currently for OSX we're disabling [app-nap](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/AppNap/AppNap.html) globally via the app's plist. If enabled, app-nap slows down performance badly for long-running activities. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5041 for more background.\r\n\r\nDisabling via the plist has a few draw-backs:\r\n- The plist setting only has an effect when running from an .app bundle. In practice, that means only when running from a packaged release\r\n- We don't distribute bitcoind in the bundle and likely never will. So app-nap is always enabled for bitcoind.\r\n- App-nap can actually be a useful feature. It would be helpful to only disable it at certain times (initial sync for example)\r\n\r\nThese changes add runtime functionality so that we can turn it on/off at-will. For now, it's enabled for the life-time of the programs, but that can be changed once we decide how to regulate it.\r\n\r\nThe CIdleInhibitor class is very ugly, but I assume that at some point we'll add similar features for other operating systems. I think this is nicer than osx ifdefs all over the place. I avoided inheritance and virtuals since we're interfacing with objc.\r\n\r\nNeeds testing on < 10.9 systems.",
