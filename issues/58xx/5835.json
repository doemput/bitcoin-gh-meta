   "body" : "I was running some benchmarks on 20MB blocks, and was surprised at how long block validation took even when all transactions had already been seen and were in the signature cache.\r\n\r\nSo I moved caching up from being a low-level signature cache to a high-level \"have we already validated this txid.\"\r\n\r\nBenchmark results on a recent 365K block with all transactions already in the memory pool / signature cache:\r\n\r\nOld code: (results from running with -debug=bench and hacked code to make sure all txn pre-validated):\r\n      - Verify 1839 txins: 191.66ms (0.104ms/txin)\r\nNew code:\r\n    - Verify 1839 txins: 2.06ms (0.001ms/txin)\r\n\r\nExtrapolating to full (1MB) blocks, the old code would spend about 600ms CPU time per hop propagating blocks with already-seen transactions, this new code will spend under 10ms.\r\n\r\nMemory usage is about 60 times smaller, also:\r\nOld code:  (sizeof(scriptSig)+std::set overhead) * number of txins  (about 200K for the 365K block)\r\nNew code: an extra 4 bytes per transaction in the mempool  (about 3K for the 365K block)\r\n\r\nI first wrote this as a standalone CTxValidationCache class, but it is simpler and more efficient to extend the mempool. The second commit in this pull request fixes two bugs in limitedmap I stumbled across when testing that code.\r\n\r\nREBASED to keep the old signature cache (see discussion below)",
