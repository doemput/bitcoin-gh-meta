It can stay stuck there for minutes at a time. A possible solution is to copy the relevant data in the notification function.\r\n\r\nThis is fighting symptoms, but will lead to a more responsive UI. The root cause would be mitigated by changing `ActivateBestChain`/`ActivateBestChainStep`/`ConnectTip` logic to release the cs_main lock between attaching blocks.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** another consequence is that the block number and progress in the UI is not updated, as it never manages to get the `cs_main` lock (it polls a few times per second, with `TRY_LOCK`). The new-block notification path (`NotifyBlockTip` Ã¢ÂÂ `ClientModel`) should be restored, with rate limiting.\r\n\r\n",
