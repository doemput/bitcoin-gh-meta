As an example, suppose it takes one minute on average to launch a new Travis worker, and the CHECK_DOC tests can run in a few seconds (or at least, less than a minute). Then if someone submits a PR there's a good chance that they'll see a red X on their pull request while the tab is still open, rather than an hour later when they go to check how the full test suite did. Feel free to close though if you think the current system makes more sense.",
