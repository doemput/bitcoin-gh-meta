      "body" : "CPFP is incredibly well-supported by miners, and should absolutely work here. abandon is a somewhat-unsupported option, and generally isn't going to help your problem as double-spending these transactions is unlikely to propagate well without RBF having been set on the initial transactions. In the future, we should be pushing people more towards RBF than abandon, as abandon has significantly more limited success.",
