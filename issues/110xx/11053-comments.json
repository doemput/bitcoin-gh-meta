So for example, if an amount.h were added to an prepended include path, nothing different would happen than already happens now.\r\n\r\nMore broadly though, it is hard to imagine taking this issue seriously, because the project already uses a mix of <> and \"\" includes, and all of the existing <> includes (as well as nearly all the \"\" includes in subdirectories below src/) are already relying on the configured include paths. And as laanwj pointed out this change is only removing include paths, not adding any, so it is strictly decreasing whatever ambiguities there may be in interpreting #include directives compared to what we are doing now.",

I don't see any way out of that, he's right and we're already screwed, and this doesn't make it better (though it does make things more consistent, if they mess up! I have to stand by that.

      "body" : "Thanks! Just to give my opinion, I think any of the following changes would be simple and minimally disruptive improvements on the status quo:\r\n\r\n1) A change using `-Isrc` and `#include<full_path>` everywhere that would make the build slightly more vulnerable to theuni's issues than we already are, but would make it more obvious what file is being included in the normal case where you don't have a messed up build configuration. This is implemented in the current PR.\r\n\r\n2) A change dropping `-Isrc` and using `#include \"../rel_path\"` everywhere that would prevent the issues raised by theuni in present and future code. This should not be hard to implement with a variation of laanwj's scripted diff.\r\n\r\n3) A change that would not alter current behavior at all, but just improve readability by replacing current hodgepodge of `#include \"rel_path\"` and `#include \"full_path\"` with `#include \"rel_path\"` and `#include <full_path>`, to make it clear when the include path is supposed to be interpreted as a relative path, and when it's supposed to be interpreted as a full path. My [pr/inc](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/inc) branch basically does this already but it would need a tweak to handle bitcoin-config.h.\r\n\r\nSlight preference for (1) over (2) over (3), but I think any of these could be good improvements and there may be other simple solutions as well (like using `-iquote` or `-I-`). \r\n\r\nIf more disruptive changes are ok, it'd also be nice to move headers in the src/ root to appropriate subdirectories. But I think that type of change would be better to handle separately and should not block simple improvements like the one implemented in this PR.",
