   "body" : "This may be a non-starter because of the rebasing caused, but I thought I'd put it out there and see what people think.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the functional tests to have a consistent naming scheme:\r\n\r\n- tests for individual RPC methods are named `rpc_...`\r\n- tests for interfaces (REST, ZMQ, RPC features) are named `interface_...`\r\n- tests that explicitly test the p2p interface are named `p2p_...`\r\n- tests for wallet features are named `wallet_...`\r\n- tests for mining features are named `mining_...`\r\n- tests for mempool behaviour are named `mempool_...`\r\n- tests for full features that aren't wallet/mining/mempool are named `feature_...`\r\n\r\nRationale: it's sometimes difficult for new contributors to know what's already covered by existing tests and where new tests should be added. Naming in a consistent fashion makes it easier to see what's already covered at a glance.\r\n\r\nI opened this after the 0.15 fork since it'll require some rebasing for other PRs. I fully understand if this is NACKed but interested in hearing other's opinions on this.\r\n\r\n(this PR will currently fail Travis since I haven't yet updated test_runner.py with the new names)",
