   "body" : "This PR addresses the tx relay trickle case specifically, but the snapshot feature can be used in other places as well, where a known set of mempool transactions are being juggled around.\r\n\r\nA new class `TxMemPoolSnapshot` is introduced (63e7997) which is instantiated from `CTxMemPool` via the `snapshot()` method. This generates a minimalized, no-locks mempool which can be queried and discarded at will. It is obviously not thread safe.\r\n\r\nIn 499f14f, this is used for the tx trickle code in `SendMessages`. This code is executed roughly 5-6 times per second. The number of LOCK(cs) inside the mempool are proportional to the number of entries in `vInvTx` (because of the sorting part using `CompareInvMempoolOrder`), which ranges in size from 0 to over 4000.\r\n\r\nI began investigating this after seeing 131703419 occurrences of `LOCK(cs)` in the mempool caused by 504302 entries into the tx relay trickle code path (that's ~250 locks per entry). This was after less than 24 hours of running.",
