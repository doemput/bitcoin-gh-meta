For this reason, I would object to using Rust in any security-oriented software, such as Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, however, Bitcoin relies on a strong guarantee that all nodes implement exactly the same logic for determining if blocks are valid or not. Comparing the exactness of two independent implementations, especially across significantly different languages (such as C++ vs Rust) is not currently possible, and as such, porting the code implementing this logic perfectly to Rust (or any other language) is likely to have undetected errors which can introduce vulnerabilities into the system (or at least, the nodes running the divergent implementation).",
