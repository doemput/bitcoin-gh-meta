   "body" : "Have you given thoughts about rewriting source code in rust? Or maybe parts of it, so part by part it could replace the totally [inefficient](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=rust&lang2=gpp) and memory unsafe language its currently written in? Let me introduce you to [rust lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) -\r\n\r\n> Rust is a programming language thatÃ¢ÂÂs focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Its design lets you create programs that have the performance and control of a low-level language, but with the powerful abstractions of a high-level language. These properties make Rust suitable for programmers who have experience in languages like C and are looking for a safer alternative, as well as those from languages like Python who are looking for ways to write code that performs better without sacrificing expressiveness.",
