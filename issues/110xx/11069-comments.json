I'm sorry guys for your time.\r\n\r\n@popenkomaksim No problem, sorry for being party pooper here.\r\n\r\nI agree that there is a large gain in some cases, and for the images that get included into the Qt GUI executable you could certainly make an argument that this should be done at some point (would it make sense to do it as part of the build process? nah, we don't want pngcrush and whatnot as build dependencies...). What I'm a bit afraid of, though, is some kind of competition about who can compress the PNGs the most, PR after PR, resulting in N different copies of the same image in history... well you understand.\r\n\r\n(However: most of the images included in the executable are very small icons, so the gain in bytes is  small there. The large images in `doc/gitian-building` aren't included in the binary distributions because they relate to building from source using gitian. So making them smaller doesn't help.)\r\n\r\n> Due a security concerns in #3341 (comment) (my machine could be possibly compromised, for example), \r\n\r\nThat could be avoided by, indeed, updating `optimize-pngs.py`, and making sure the process is deterministic. If a few people can follow the steps and get the same result, worries about individual's computers being compromised are alleviated.",
