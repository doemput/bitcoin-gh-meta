It's good enough to be put in a separate function. The problem is that it's doing the \"logical and\" only on the first two uint. The other uint should be zeroed. For example the base_uint::operator==(const base_uint& a, uint64 b) do checks the other uint of the base_uint for 0. This problem isn't present with the ^= and the |= operators because anything ^ 0 = anything, and anything | 0 = anything.\r\n",
