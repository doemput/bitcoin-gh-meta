Clicking the \"x\" hides the window, and the tray icon can bring it back instantly. \r\n\r\nBTW a pet peeve of mine is that these separate options are pretty confusing. Do we really them need both? It seems that most programs with similar background functionality implement \"Minimize to tray on close\". \r\n",
