The only thing that changes is the fact that the IP is now different. So in the log you'll get:\r\n\r\naddrLocalHost = something\r\naddrLocalHost = 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\nI think the second printf should be distinguished by the first (something like\" setting addrLocalHost to 0.0.0.0 because of proxy/no incoming connection) and probably the first part (the one that finds the local ip) shouldn't directly be done in this situation.",
