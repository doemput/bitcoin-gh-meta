   "body" : "This patch enables compressed pubkeys when -compressedpubkeys is passed.\r\nThese are 33 bytes instead of 65, and require only marginally more CPU\r\npower when verifying. Compressed pubkeys have a different corresponding\r\naddress, so it is determined at generation. When -compressedpubkeys is\r\ngiven, all newly generated addresses will use a compressed key, while\r\nolder/other addresses keep using normal keys. Unpatched clients will\r\nrelay and verify these transactions.\r\n\r\nTested on testnet with both normal and encrypted wallets, using compressed and non-compressed keys.\r\n\r\nInitial idea and tests for this patch were done by roconnor.",
