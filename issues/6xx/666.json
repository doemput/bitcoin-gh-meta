This makes casting between them\r\n\timpossible, so converting between the two at API boundaries requires\r\n\tcalling ::c_str() for now.\r\n\r\nThe lack of implicit casting between the two was a big advantage in making this patch thorough, since the build would break if not all the prototypes were updated. So it should also be a 'feature' in making sure implicit casts (meaning gratuitous copies into non-locked memory) aren't accidentally introduced in the future.\r\n\r\nPassphrases are now only copied from non-locked memory in askpassphrasedialog.cpp (from Qt's QLineEdit / QString) and in bitcoinrpc.cpp (from whatever library is providing Array; I couldn't tell).",
