Date wise, address wise, credit or debit wise, description wise etc.\r\nIt shows default date wise only & that cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nAs said before send coins & address book button gets shadows & also the button pressed look stays that way(the box goes down) , but minimize & bringing it back from task bar removes shadows & pressed button look.",
