   "body" : "With the current client it is impossible to start mulitple instances of bitcoin on one system, as they compete for the listen port. This patch adds a command line option to not accept bitcoin connection from outside. \r\n\r\nThis can be useful in some cases:\r\n\r\n* Testing e-commerce software on the testnet with multiple clients on one machine (akin to paypal sandbox testing)\r\n* When multiple users on one shared server want to run the bitcoin client\r\n* As a primitive security measure\r\n\r\nOf course it would be even better to specify a port to listen on on the command line, but as I understood the current protocol has no support for alternative ports, so this would be useless.",
