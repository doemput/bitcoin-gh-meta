   "body" : "currently (2011/03/01) a backlog of transactions that dont seem make it into blocks is building up (according to ArtForz now 670 transactions). \n\nPeople are starting to complain, see http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3835.msg57031#msg57031 for an example.\n\nThis was discussed on #bitcoin-dev\n\nArtForz> that tx should have a score of 20567855\nArtForz> so it falls short of the dPriority > COIN * 144 / 250 test\nArtForz> and as tx size is > 4000, fAllowFree is never true for it\ntheymos> Ah. So it will never confirm?\nArtForz> probably not\n\nArtForz> looks like the tx-sending code needs some fixing\nmolecular> like not generate a tx with a score too low, or suggest to add a fee?\nArtForz> yep\nArtForz> check size and priority of transaction, if it's > 4kB and score < 57600000 require min fee\nArtForz> maybe reduce the size limit to 3.5k or so, otherwise it can only get into an otherwise empty block\n\nThis also seems to imply the possiblity of a DoS-Attack on node RAM, since the tx-queue is kept im RAM. Maybe the transaction cache should not be unlimited?\n",
