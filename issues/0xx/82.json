I didn't want to make a new pull request but I couldn't find another way to do it.\r\n\r\nThe last comment by tcatm was \"This patch works ... outputs annoying errors (wx-config not found) when building bitcoind. Can you fix that?\"\r\n\r\nI have fixed it in this branch (it no longer tries to include wx at all for any non-GUI files), and updated the readme to say it's OK to use wx 2.9.1 now. It now builds bitcoind just fine even if your system has no trace of wxWidgets.",
