Backup Wallet for example should have them, every other option should have theirs removed. \r\n* Every menu item should have all words capitalized. At the moment \"Sign message\" and others aren't following this, while some are. \r\n* The naming of the Options panel is inconsistent on OSX. In the menu it is called \"Preferences\", and in the title it is called \"Options\". To fit with the other OS builds, I suggest that the title of the window is renamed to \"Preferences\", but only on OSX.\r\n\r\nI would have submitted a pull with the menu modifications myself, but \"Verify Message\" doesn't seem to have an entry in the localization files, and I'm not sure why this is. \r\n",
