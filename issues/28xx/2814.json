Cost is O(1) for mempool.accept() and limited to O(n) when a new block changes what transactions are in the mempool, either due to them being mined, conflicts, or reinstated by a re-org.\r\n\r\nI haven't changed the mining code, and don't keep track of sigops yet. This isn't useful without mining code and mempool expiration so it's not ready to be actually pulled yet. (mainly I want to see what the pulltester thinks)\r\n\r\nNote that this is a safe implementation, not a 100% accurate one, for reasons mentioned in CMemPoolTx::calcPrioritySums() In addition the memoized approach can't directly handle the case where a transaction with a lot of outputs is made worthwhile to mine because of multiple children.",
