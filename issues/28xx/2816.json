I frequently do gitian builds for Litecoin, and I am thinking about designing a better procedure for getting a lot more people involved in regular gitian verification.  Meanwhile here is my key to be able to participate in the existing release procedure.\r\n\r\nhttp://wtogami.blogspot.com/2013/05/gitian-for-fedora.html\r\nI ported Gitian to Fedora and it has been working perfectly.\r\n\r\nhttp://wtogami.blogspot.com/2013/06/transition-to-new-gpg-key.html\r\nMy GPG key is signed by my old GPG key which is fairly well connected in the FOSS world.",
