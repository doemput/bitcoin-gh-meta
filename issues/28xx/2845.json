Eliminates the possibility of timing attacks by changing the way the two passwords are compared. \r\nIt iterates through each char in the strings, and if the two chars it is comparing aren't the same, then it adds 1 to nReturn and the function, once it's done comparing all the chars, will return false. Previously, the function would return false on the first char that didn't match, allowing a possible attacker to run a timing attack.\r\n\r\nSee http://rdist.root.org/2010/01/07/timing-independent-array-comparison/ for reference.\r\n\r\n",
