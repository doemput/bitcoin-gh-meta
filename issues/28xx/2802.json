   "body" : "Changes:\r\n* Maintain a salt to perturbate the address index (protection against collisions).\r\n* Add support for address index entries in the block index, and maintain those if -addrindex is specified. It indexes the use of every >8-byte data push in output script or consumed script - or in case of no such push, the entire script.\r\n* Add a searchrawtransactions RPC call, which can look up raw transactions by address.\r\n\r\nI both hate and love this patch. I hate making it easy to build infrastructure that relies on a fully-indexed blockchain (which shouldn't be necessary), as it may remove the incentive to build more scalable solutions. On the other hand, in cases where the alternative is relying on a trusted third party, this approach is certainly preferable, and would allow an RPC-based blockexplorer, for example.\r\n\r\nA full -txindex=1 -addrindex=1 index is about 2.7 GiB now.",
