We very much like people to build from git tags, but apparently this is hard or at least inconvenient for some infrastructure out there. I hope the overhead is minimal enough for those doing the release...\r\n\r\nThis also disables the use of git-describe in exported source archives, as it results in a spurious error otherwise.\r\n\r\nI hope this closes #2476.",
