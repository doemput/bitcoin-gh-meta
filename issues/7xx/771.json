Ive looked at it in valgrind and gprofile and tried changing some possible culprits and havent had any luck tracking it down.  _If anyone tracks it down, Ill owe you big time._~~\r\n**Additionally, please mind the removal of cs_main around stuff thats not in main.cpp (esp rpc) and tell me Im wrong to do that.**",
