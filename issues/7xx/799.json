Since users shouldn't have exposed RPC ports OR\r\nshort passwords, the DOS risk is preferable to the compromise\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nAlso logs the client IP address for incorrect attempts.\r\n\r\nWith this patch running bitcoind when there is no configuration file now results in:\r\n[gmaxwell@helmholtz src]$ ./bitcoind\r\nError: To use bitcoind, you must set a rpcpassword in the configuration file:\r\n/home/gmaxwell/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\r\nIt is recommended you use the following random password:\r\nrpcuser=bitcoinrpc\r\nrpcpassword=HXt6c9zmw6jqW4jvh3pcHTGb7owrmNLUtaSVGvoT2Sho\r\n(you do not need to remember this password)\r\nIf the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.\r\n\r\nPreviously it just advised rpcpassword= which probably gets filled in with insecure normal password like values.\r\n\r\nI think ideally bitcoin would just autocreate the file with a random authentication string like thisÃ¢ÂÂ but I thought this change was more minimal. Thoughts?\r\n",
