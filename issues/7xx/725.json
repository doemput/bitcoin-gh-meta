Applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g. via privoxy or socat) instead. For more information, please see http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a brief chat in #Tor on irc.oftc.net:\r\n\r\nYou can modify your socks code to connect to a hostname\r\n(you can use an IP address as hostname without any trouble, if you're using socks5)\r\nor you can use socks4a and stuff will also just work\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know nuthin about SOCKS, but I'm hoping somebody else does and can fix this...\r\n",
