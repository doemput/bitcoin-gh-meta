   "body" : "Currently I keep my entire `~/.bitcoin` directory on an encrypted *eCryptFS* filesystem. However, loading the entire block DB from it is relatively slow, and due to issue #660 it is impossible to keep `.bitcoin` in plain and symlink `wallet.dat`/`addr.dat` from the private filesystem. I assume that symlinking `blk*.dat` would cause the same problems as in #660.\r\n\r\nHence this feature request: Allow storing the public data (`blk*.dat`, `__db.*`, `database/log.*`) *in a separate directory* from private data.\r\n\r\nOn Linux, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Bitcoin` (aka `~/.cache/Bitcoin/`) would be a good choice for the block DB and related files, while the private data could go to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Bitcoin` (aka `~/.config/Bitcoin`). On Windows, `AppData/Local/Bitcoin` and `AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin` respectively. Those are only suggestions though; a simple `~/.bitcoin/private/` directory would be sufficient.",
