This functionality used\r\nto be part of CAddress, which also contains network flags and\r\nconnection attempt information. These extra fields are however\r\nnot always necessary.\r\n\r\nThese classes, along with logic for creating connections and\r\ndoing name lookups, are moved to netbase.{h,cpp}, which does not\r\ndepend on headers.h.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, CNetAddr is completely IPv6-ready, though IPv6\r\nfunctionality is not yet enabled for the application itself.",
