      "body" : "@luke-jr Yes, I realise this is a very old one hence the smiley, but it seems that with various other bitcoin nodes out there, for example, Unlimited are using Protocol Version >80000, which means that Core will assume it provides services such as compact blocks, SegWit, etc when it does not. I am thinking that the PROTOCOL_VERSION ought not to be relied upon as developers are moving away from it for reasons that need to be better understood. I suspect those reasons are that it doesn't suit multiple development teams as it enforces a level of linearity (i.e. all developers are expected to provide functionality before they can bump their version number) but not on a \"level playing field\". I.e. some developers might not want to add SegWit, but might want to add XThin - what should the protocol version be in that scenario?",

That said, this incrementing p2p protocol version number is probably growing increasingly useless, and it might make sense to redefine it as a pair of 16-bit version number (with the current usage) and make the remaining into additional service bits.
