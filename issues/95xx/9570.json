   "body" : "This fixes #9148, though with a bit more code than I intended.\r\n\r\nThere were two issues: a) wallet could return data based on partial block processing, because there were no locks between SyncTransaction calls, which is fixed relatively easily. and b) you could be busy-waiting on getbestblockheight , and call getbalance immediately after that changed, getting your balance as of the previous block instead of the new one, which is a regression in master from 0.13.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the second, we introduce a primitive to block until the wallet has caught up either with the current chain, or the best chain (to resolve a simple race condition).\r\n\r\nThis should probably get a test case, because I know you can see a in simple tests, but I'm not 100% sure about b.",
