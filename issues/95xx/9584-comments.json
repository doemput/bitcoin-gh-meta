There dont seem to be too many issues here, however, there is at least one - you could go to select coins, need to use 0-conf change, but such 0-conf change may have been included in a block who's callbacks have not yet been processed - resulting in thinking they are not in mempool and, thus, not selectable.",

      "body" : "@ryanofsky they were technically fixed in #9583, but I do not believe #10286 introduces any new (serious) bugs. It is the case that you may not select some coins based on a mistaken belief that they are unconfirmed when they are, but this should still only happen if they confirmed in a block you processed *after* the RPC call was entered (ie after the block-until-caught-up call) but before the actual CreateTransaction call. I do not believe it ever is an issue, but its probably worth re-reading (and re-re-reading) a bunch of wallet logic to make sure the new InMempool()-may-be-out-of-sync-with-GetDepthInMainChain() semantics dont cause issues.",
