This does not necessarily need to be part of \"make check\" or Travis, but something that can be run separately and just does some automatic tests would make sense, I think.\r\n",

I feel like perhaps a \"test\" subfolder would be best. Putting them in qa/rpc-tests or src/test wouldn't really work. Maybe contrib/test could be created so that everything's in one place? I'm open to ideas.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
