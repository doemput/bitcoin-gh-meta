   "body" : "In line with conversation about the risks of BIP37 peer bloom filters (#6579, #7708), Bitcoin Core should throw a warning during init if the `peerbloomfilters` boolean is enabled (this is currently set by default). Running `NODE_BLOOM` enabled presents severe risks to node operators (#9238) which they may be unaware of. \r\n\r\nIn public knowledge the p2p protocol extension has been used for large scale anti attacks using the `mempool` command to bypass transaction trickling, denial of service due to the enormous CPU load caused by the act of filtering blocks, and potentially other undisclosed issues. This is a stepping stone towards eventually default disabling the feature. \r\n",
