This means that not even critical security\n-updates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin\n-wallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.\n-\n-In addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core\n-randomly crashing on Windows XP. It is [not clear](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7681#issuecomment-217439891)\n-what the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream\n-libraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.\n-\n-We do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is\n-end-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are\n-suggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or install an alternative OS\n-that is supported.\n-\n-No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,\n-you can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not\n-report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\n+Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\n+the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.\n+\n+Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support).\n+No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you\n+can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities.\n+Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Inix-like systems but is not",
