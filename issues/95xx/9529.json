Instead the locally scoped variable `lastDate` was updated.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in `self.lastDate` being kept constant at its initial value `datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1)` during the lifetime of the `BlockDataCopier` object, which in turn meant that the check ...\r\n\r\n    if self.timestampSplit and (blkDate > self.lastDate):\r\n\r\n... was effectively reduced to ...\r\n\r\n    if self.timestampSplit:\r\n\r\n... since `self.lastDate` was stuck at 2000-01-01.",
