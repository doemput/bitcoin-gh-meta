Changes have been made in master to fix up issues with Protobuf 3.x, but I don't think they we're back-ported, so you'll need to use Protobuf 2.60 with the 0.13.x branch. See the [0.13.x osx dependencies](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.13/doc/build-osx.md#dependencies).\r\n\r\nYou should be able to uninstall/unlink protobuf and install\r\n```\r\nhomebrew/versions/protobuf260 --c++11\r\n```",
