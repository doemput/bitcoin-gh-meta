If this is desired, I'm happy to rebase this after #5478's merge.\r\n\r\nSince uint256 has .begin() and .size(), I don't see why we should trust that a pointer to the object lines up with the data we're after rather than using those functions.\r\n\r\nI did a naive grep to find these, there are likely others as well.",
