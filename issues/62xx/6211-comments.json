      "body" : "Hello. When I was working on Armory, C++11 code was added in 0.93. We did this before realizing that, as mentioned here, Ubuntu 12.04 can't compile C++11 code by default. We also had trouble figuring out how to compile a version of Armory that would run in 12.04. [This commit](https://github.com/etotheipi/BitcoinArmory/commit/34fd8903da0f7dc500ced3c150f4c1fea161d84e) shows what we settled on. The solution we developed was to tell people that, unfortunately, they couldn't build Armory on 12.04 without switching to clang or a non-standard GCC 4.7.3 or 4.8+ package floating around out there. (Fortunately, I know of nobody compiling Armory on 12.04. I know Core probably doesn't have that luxury.) The best we were able to do was set things up such that static compiling and a SWIG workaround allowed 12.10 and beyond to create a binary that could run on 12.04.\r\n\r\nI'm hard pressed to give a firm opinion on when C++11 should be introduced to Core. My initial thought is to go with what Gavin said, although I know 0.12 is getting close to the release date. So, 0.13 would likely be a better starting point at this point. However, Luke probably brings up a good point regarding ABI issues, which I've heard about here and there. I don't know enough to say whether or not he's right. If anybody has a test that I can run by compiling Armory in Ubuntu 15.10 (I believe it uses GCC 5.2 by default), let me know and I'll be happy to do it. I've got VMs out the wazoo.\r\n\r\nThanks for making it this far. :)",

      "body" : "+1 for C++11. Given that we're approaching 2016, +1 for C++14 (which GCC 5 fully supports).\r\n\r\nA number of benefits have been listed, primarily around auto/rvalue refs/range-based for, but I think the real driving factor is the potential safety improvements. C++11 and C++14 are moving toward a more functional paradigm, with first-class functions (std::function) and lambdas (which can be closures), and a more generic paradigm with auto, variadic templates, static_assert, and new/improved type traits.\r\n\r\nBy upgrading, we're rewarded with added compile-time type safety (with improved generics, constexpr functions, and static_assert), memory safety (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, std::weak_ptr, std::array), and thread safety (std::thread, std::future, std::mutex, std::atomic, and a new thread-aware memory model).\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to help with this migration and I'm hoping that this ball can get rolling ASAP.",

My understanding is that the devs are pretty conservative when it comes to supporting development environments, hence Wladimir's opening statement regarding Ubuntu 12.04. My understanding is also that Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't officially support GCC 4.9 (mostly complete C++14 support), although there are some unofficial (?) packages. There's also the matter of the Windows build, which uses MinGW to create a Windows build. The Gitian setup that generates the official Windows build uses 14.04 too, and GCC-MinGW has the same version issue (4.8.2) as regular GCC. Ubuntu 15.10 is the first version to properly (AFAIK) support C++14. Once 14.04 has faded enough from the spotlight and been replaced by 16.04, C++14 may be reasonable. Until then, it's probably best to avoid it for at least a couple of years. :(\r\n\r\nOf course, if any devs want to correct me, please do. :) Also, C++14 is technically off-topic here. A new issue should probably be opened if C++14 support is considered critical enough.",

Many of them have supported it for quite some time and are moving on to newer standards.\r\n\r\n> It's unfortunate that Travis doesn't support Ubuntu 14.04 yet. Don't know what version of gcc it is running but this may effectively undermine our automatic testing after using some C++11 features.\r\n\r\nPlenty of projects, including some of mine, are using C++11 (and 14) with travis. Here's a [quick example](https://github.com/jeaye/color_coded/blob/master/.travis.yml) and [a related SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22111549/travis-ci-with-clang-3-4-and-c11/30925448#30925448).",

      "body" : "@luke-jr Following what @dcousens said, simply _speculating_ that there may be issues shouldn't prevent us from trying this out. There is absolutely the possibility, depending on bitcoin's dependencies (with which I'm unfamiliar), that bitcoin relies on a C++ library, which is statically linked, that doesn't provide a C++11 build. However, that very well may not be the case; I can't speak for every platform on this one.\r\n\r\nOS X, for example, allows boost with C++11 through homebrew with a simple additional flag during install. Further investigation would be needed on various platforms (admittedly, most of my systems are rather bleeding edge, so, again, I can't speak for others).\r\n\r\n*If* we end up with some dependencies which need manual recompilation on older distros, like Ubuntu 12, we can consider packaging them along with bitcoin and building them separately. It's common to do this with boost (I know of multiple projects which do).",

Furthermore, for compiled C++ programs, tracing the run-time dependencies (using ldd, for example) is much easier than something like Python.\r\n\r\nAlas, how much investigation and assurance is required is currently unknown.

I've never even heard of this issue apart from here. In the cases where this could be an issue, we should add a warning and start suggesting building boost and Qt from scratch, I guess. But I'm not going to hold off the use of c++11 in Bitcoin Core on this.\r\n",
