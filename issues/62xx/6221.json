Previously, the pruning code\r\nwould stop looking for files to remove upon first encountering a file\r\ncontaining a block that cannot be pruned, now it will keep looking for\r\ncandidate files until the target is met and all other criteria are\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThis can result in a noncontiguous set of block files (by number) on\r\ndisk, which is fine except for during some reindex corner cases, so\r\nmake reindex preparation smarter such that we keep the data we can\r\nactually use and throw away the rest.  This allows pruning to work\r\ncorrectly while downloading any blocks needed during the reindex.",
