   "body" : "This is part of a much larger networking refactor.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a while looking at different approaches for cleaning up the networking code, it's become apparent that some functions/classes are going to have to drop cs_main in favor of using their own fine-grained locks.\r\n\r\nBreaking up cs_main would be a monstrous task, and would likely be even harder to review.\r\n\r\nAs a first step, I've fixed up our locking so that LOCK() and friends play nicely with clang's -Wthread-safety static-analysis option. This will allow us to document locking assumptions while verifying them at the same time. I added https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a794284e61988a226ea39327449be9906a1b5abd as an example of how this is useful.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to add the EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_main)/GUARDED_BY(cs_main) as needed for functions that need to be broken out of the cs_main lock, that way locking changes can be verified much more easily.\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n```bash\r\n./configure CXXFLAGS=\"-O2 -g -Wthread-safety\" CXX=clang++ CC=clang\r\n```\r\nTo see an example of a failure in action, comment out ```LOCK(cs_main);``` in ```FinalizeNode()```. The result should be something like:\r\n```\r\nmain.cpp:293:5: warning: calling function 'EraseOrphansFor' requires exclusive lock on 'cs_main' [-Wthread-safety-analysis]\r\n    EraseOrphansFor(nodeid);\r\n```",
