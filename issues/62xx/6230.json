   "body" : "It's nicer to have all the hardcoded hashes of the genesis blocks of the respective supported chains together.\r\nMore importantly, all chains should have the genesis block as checkpoint. That way the checkpoint logic can always trust the first checkpoint and hopefully we will be able to save some ```if (block.GetHash() != chainparams.GetConsensus().hashGenesisBlock)``` here and there.\r\nI also add some tests to checkpoints. They're not very important since the asserts in chainparams would already detect any change in the genesis block, but it makes sure that \"the checkpoint logic can always trust the first checkpoint\".\r\nIn fact, the genesis checkpoint is that is immune to reorgs, by definition.\r\nThe genesis block is the first rule and the only true chain ID (because one based in names would require a memorable-ID system [and those are centralized and/or vulnerable to squatting]).\r\n(Shares base commit with #6229)",
