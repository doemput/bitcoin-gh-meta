   "body" : "This pull request aims at adding autotools for build checks, configure\nflags  for   compile  time  configuration  and   handling  of  #define\ndirectives inside code  and things that will possibily  make it better\nfor bitcoin  to be  packaged inside distributions,  as well  ported to\ndifferent architectures.\n\nBuild of this branch was tested on Debian 6 (also with WX GUI), Apple\nOSX 10.5 (no WX GUI) and CYGWIN win32 (no UPNP nor WX)\n\n**completed**\n\nadd autotools build system\n====================\n\n* commit ref: jaromil@500da9eb20d480c431d610472bfa3af92112aead\n    \n    this pull request follows as third attempt to previous 2:\n    * https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/162\n    * https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/177\n    \n    and   basically   consists   of    a   rebase   of   this   branch\n    https://github.com/jaromil/bitcoin/commits/master  eliminating all\n    those commits and squashing them in 2 steps.\n    \n    1st commit moves files around under old build system\n    \n    2nd commit converts the build system to autotools\n        (while we still leave the old build system in place, optional)\n    \nthe bitcoind code  itself was never modified: files  were moved around\nand  the  header auto-config.h  generated  by  autoconf  was added  to\nheaders.h\n    \ncode  modules have been  separated in  subdirectories and  compiled as\nstatic  libraries,  still  using  libtool, which  is  the  recommended\nbehaviour when using autotools.\n \ninteresting configure flags\n---------------------   \n\n * --enable-upnp=0/1   has  been   added  and   configure.ac  contains\n     templates for adding more compile time choices in future.\n\n * --enable-gui  has been added  also to  activate compilation  of the\n     included WX GUI. other wx  related flags are provided to indicate\n     prefix or static library build.\n\n * --enable-debug compiles  the binaries with  debugging flags, giving\n     all warnings - anyone willing to help should run it at least once\n     :)\n\n * --enable-profiling enables support for gprof the GNU profiler (will\n     dump gmon.out files after run)\n\n * --with-wxdir=PATH Use uninstalled version of wxWidgets in PATH\n\n * --with-wx-prefix=PREFIX Prefix where wxWidgets is installed\n     (optional)\n\n * --with-boost and more boost build configuration\n\ncode re-organization\n===============\n\n* commit ref: jaromil@84c3fb07b0b8199c7f85c5de280e7100bad0786f\n\n    directory re-organization (keeps the old build system)\n    \n    there is no internal modification of any file in this commit\n    \n    files  are   moved  into  directories   according  to  established\n    standards in sourcecode distribution; these directories contain:\n    \n    * src  -  Files  that  are  used in  constructing  the  executable\n      binaries\n    \n    * doc - Files in HTML  and text format that document usage, quirks\n      of the implementation, and contributor checklists.\n    \n    * locale  -  Files  that  contain human  language  translation  of\n      strings used in the program\n    \n    * contrib -  Files contributed  from distributions or  other third\n      party implementing scripts and auxiliary programs\n",
