   "body" : "I think RPC access is important enough that it should be enabled by default. This would allow greater integration with other applications.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we could support Bitcoin URIs (issue #14) by having a `bitcoin openuri` command that would open the \"Send Coins\" dialog box with the address and amount pre-populated.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose the a small changes:\r\n\r\n- The `-server` flag is deprecated and the server config option is considered on (1) by default.\r\n- A `-noserver` flag added to explicitly turn off the RPC server at the command line.\r\n- If there is an `rpcpassword` field in the `bitcoin.conf` file, that password is used.\r\n- Otherwise, a random password is generated on startup, and placed in a file called `bitcoin.password` (user readable only).\r\n\r\nIf people think this is a good idea, I can put together a patch for this.",
