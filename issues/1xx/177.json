   "body" : "adding autotools for build checks, configure flags for compile time\nconfiguration and handling of #define directives inside code and\nthings that will possibily make it better for bitcoin to be packaged\ninside distributions, as well ported to different architectures.\n\nthis pull request follows my first sloppy attempt here:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/162\ni've followed suggestions given by jgarzik, thanks for your patience\n\nthis pull request is a rebase of this branch\nhttps://github.com/jaromil/bitcoin/commits/master\nwhich eliminates all those commits and squashes them in this.\n\nthe bitcoind code itself was never modified, just moved around, with\ntwo exceptions:\n\n1) 9141f2c renamed cryptopp/config.h to settings.h\n2) c929bae code namespace change: (int)VERSION renamed to\n   BITCOIN_VERSION in headers.h\n\nso just one filename and one variable name changed, plus one #ifdef\ninside headers.h\n\ncode modules have been separated in subdirectories and compiled as\nstatic libraries, still using libtool, which is the recommended\nbehaviour when using autotools.\n\na flag --enable-upnp=0/1 has been added and configure.ac contains\ntemplates for adding more compile time choices in future.\n\nas libbitcoin will be provided in future, ABI versioning is also ready\nto be adopted via libtool.\n\nthe test/ directory is imported from gasteve's branch for test units.\n\nBuild of this was tested on Debian 6 (also with WX GUI), Apple OSX\n10.5 (without WX GUI) and CYGWIN win32 (without dependencies).",
