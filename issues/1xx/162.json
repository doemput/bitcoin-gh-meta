   "body" : "just a start, needs more detections at configure, however works to build the daemon alone for now.\r\nmore flags should be present on ./configure to select gui build and detect required libraries.\r\nlibtool is just used to build the internal libcryptopp, but we can ship libbitcoin.so in future.\r\n\r\nthe aim of this fork is mostly that of GNUification for bitcoin codebase and process separation.\r\ncode will be shared between daemon and client implementations via shared libraries.\r\n\r\nit might look as a traumatic for now, but well think of the long term...\r\nconsider no code was changed in this commit, just moved around.\r\nwin32 and osx builds can be fixed to work using autotools or a parallel cmake build.\r\n\r\napologies for not having created a branch, i've pushed on my fork's master.\r\nif that is a problem i can redo that quickly.",
