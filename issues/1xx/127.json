The RPC will happily return that address even though it isn't yours.\n\nThis is a problem when switching from wxGUI to a RPC UI.\n\nFixed by adding\n\n    foreach(const PAIRTYPE(string, string)& entry, mapAddressBook)  \n       uint160 hash160;\n       if(AddressToHash160(entry.first, hash160) && mapPubKeys.count(hash160)) // This address belongs to me\n           mapAccountBalances[entry.second] = 0;\nto make sure that mapAccountBalances doesn't contain any addresses that we don't have in our key list.\n\nMy previous request didn't build. *whoops* Fixed for sure this time.",
