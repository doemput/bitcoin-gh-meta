I'm not sure if it's enough to fix it completely, but it addresses the bulk of the pkg-config issue.\r\n\r\nThe second commit (maybe) addresses #6486. I noticed it while I was looking at configure. It's not clear if #6486 is a real bug for that user or not, but either way it was prone to failure before and should work as expected after the change.",
