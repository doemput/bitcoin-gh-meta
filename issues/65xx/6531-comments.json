Considering that, in a healthy fee market environment, there will always be new transactions with a fee that causes new work to be required to match the filter, I'm not too concerned with churn causing poor filter matches. Remember such a metric is really only to make such systems work in the face of an attacker who is deliberately breaking them.\r\n\r\nRegarding the need for such a system: it isnt just about centralized systems. It makes just as much sense in a decentralized one as well, if that one has a need for mempool syncing to compress blocks (all current block compression protocols have this requirement). In a decentralized one, you would need to sync your mempool-discard-transaction-selection to use the same metric.",

It is a problem for the current relay node block compression algorithm, but that is only because it is compressing based on the contents of a single mempool.\r\n\r\nThe number of miners is fairly limited and I do not expect any of them to have a problem to carry compression dictionaries for the next 5-10 expected blocks of each significant miner, even if all of them carry a different subset of low priority \"spam\" transactions in the tail of their blocks. We all have mostly  the same transactions in our mempools, and only ordering differ somewhat. For an attacker to make a noticeable problem for a distributed compression he would need to find fast paths into many miners, being able to carefully control their mempool contents. Just doing the attack on 3-4 paths in the network is not very significant from a distributed compression ratio perspective.\r\n\r\nadditionally the \"split view\" across the network exists no matter what same-fee ordering priority is used as the same can be accomplished with doublespend transactions.",
