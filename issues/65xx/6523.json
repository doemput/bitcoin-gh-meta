   "body" : "This is a start at implementing FullBlockTestGenerator.java in python. Almost all the work is by @sdaftuar, I just did some final cleanup here and there. The main test is `p2p-fullblocktest.py`, and should be pretty easy to understand,\r\n\r\nIt currently implements only a few of the tests from FullBlockTestGenerator.java, but it's a start.\r\n\r\n`create_coinbase()` now takes a height argument, so there are some changes to unrelated tests, as well as some new functionality added to the testing framework, to support the new tests.",
