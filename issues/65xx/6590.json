   "body" : "The fix is debatable, but it points out the real issue: when testing with Windows, stale sockets from previous runs cause the current tests' listen sockets to be unavailable, leading to nodes that never sync. I'm sure that translates to real-world issues as well, for example watchdog scripts would likely fail to work as intended. I'm not sure if there's a more proper way to fix the problem for Windows, so I just copied the behavior we already use for Unix.\r\n\r\nThis may be part of the root cause of #6554, but I'm not sure about that.\r\n\r\nWith that fixed, these test run fine locally. Note that they do take quite a while to run though, so we might not want to enable them on Travis for every PR/push.",
