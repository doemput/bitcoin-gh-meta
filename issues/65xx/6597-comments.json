Besides they were (or at least they currently seem to be) unnecessary for #6382 (or for facilitating the creating of testchains in general by not requiring tester to \"mine\" the genesis block of their testchains: the genesis block is correct by definition).\r\nNow it should be clear that we're just optimizing the genesis block case in ConnectBlock() without adding any work to the other cases, and we're only affecting negatively the performance of CBlockTreeDB::LoadBlockIndexGuts by comparing two hashes right before returning and error (only if CheckProofOfWork had previously failed), which I think is very acceptable.\r\nSo I don't think benchmarking this makes sense anymore.",

Have you actually reproduced the error you claim would appear?\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't be necessary, certainly not in CheckBlockHeader(). In AcceptBlockHeader, it won't be called for the genesis block, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L3071\r\nMaybe it is required on TestBlockValidity() or something else that calls CheckBlock() (which calls CheckBlockHeader()), but I would prefer to leave the genesis block check out of the consensus function CheckBlockHeader().\r\n\r\nProbably a good test for this would be to create a new regtest-like chain with a genesis block that doesn't satisfy the proof of work and run it for a few blocks both with and without reindex from the python tests. But without #6907 and something like https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/98923c381eca9874f135f08297218f3f8fff5221 it seems like the testing would be much more than the change itself.",

As said the very fact that we disagree on whether or not this is enough for its stated goal, means IMO that this should be introduced with  tests that verify this is enough and will keep being enough in the future (make sure nobody undoes this without noticing).\r\nI believe the best way to test this is through a new chain whose genesis block doesn't  pass pow (regtest2 ?) And test boh with and without reindex.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\r\n\r\nAddionally, I don't  plan to create a new chain without #6907 (and generic selection with -chain, also part of #6382 ),and that's  why I'm  closing this for now.\r\nAnyone feel free to take over this if you can't  wait for the factory. I've  personally been wanting this factory for almost two years, I can wait more for #6907 to be merged (was supposed to happen before forking 0.12, I really hope it will happen before forking 0.13.",
