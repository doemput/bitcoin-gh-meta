   "body" : "We are experimenting issues while mining using RPC API in version 0.10.0 \r\n\r\nScenario: private testnet, not connected to the public testnet with a custom genesis block. We use it to run integration tests of our software. To reduce the testing time, we restore the blockchain to a known state every time the tests are run. \r\n\r\nThe whole system were working perfectly. After upgrading `bitcoind` to version 0.10.0, we cannot mine anymore. `bitcoind` responds with an error 500 with the error message _Bitcoin is downloading blocks..._, even when the daemon has fully reindexed the contents and using the flag `-checkpoints=0`. \r\n\r\nReading the source code of Bitcoin, we realized there is a check that is causing the daemon to consider it is downloading blocks even when it is not. In `src/rpcmining.cpp` we have this guard:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    if (IsInitialBlockDownload())\r\n        throw JSONRPCError(RPC_CLIENT_IN_INITIAL_DOWNLOAD, \"Bitcoin is downloading blocks...\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the result of `IsInitialBlockDownload()` is the clue. We have the following implementation.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool IsInitialBlockDownload()\r\n{\r\n    LOCK(cs_main);\r\n    if (fImporting || fReindex || chainActive.Height() < Checkpoints::GetTotalBlocksEstimate())\r\n        return true;\r\n    static bool lockIBDState = false;\r\n    if (lockIBDState)\r\n        return false;\r\n    bool state = (chainActive.Height() < pindexBestHeader->nHeight - 24 * 6 ||\r\n            pindexBestHeader->GetBlockTime() < GetTime() - 24 * 60 * 60);\r\n    if (!state)\r\n        lockIBDState = true;\r\n    return state;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging, we found out the problem is caused by the following expression.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\npindexBestHeader->GetBlockTime() < GetTime() - 24 * 60 * 60\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we understand it well, a best header mined before 24 hours ago means the initial block is being downloading. That could make sense for mainnet and public testnet, but breaks the possibility to have a private testnet with private miners that had interrupted the mining process at some instant for more than 24 hours. \r\n\r\nWe recompiled `bitcoind` with the following expression for `state` variable and the miner succeed to connect to the daemon and is mining without problems. \r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    bool state = (chainActive.Height() < pindexBestHeader->nHeight - 24 * 6);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe don't understand perfectly what's the purpose of this state calculation and what would be the effect to remove this guard. So we cannot provide a patch to fix it. Any idea on how to fix this issue?\r\n",
