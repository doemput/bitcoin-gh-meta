This means that we don't have to prevent accepting a side branch anymore - it will be safe, just less fast to do.\r\n\r\nWe still need to prevent being fed a multitude of low-difficulty headers filling up our memory. The mechanism for that is unchanged for now: once a checkpoint is reached with headers, no headers chain branching off before that point are allowed anymore.",
