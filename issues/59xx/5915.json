   "body" : "This one's really subtle. Fixes #5910. Confirmed fixed in gitian.\r\n\r\nSee here for background: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-34748\r\n\r\nlibxcb temporarily had an abi breakage which caused crashes when qt was compiled against a non-compatible version. Building qt with -qt-xcb should have shielded us from this issue, except that incompatible headers were used when building qt's wrapper.\r\n\r\nMake sure those headers aren't picked up by qt's build.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nqt's build adds a wrapper around the xcb libs when -qt-xcb is used. This is done to avoid having to link to a handful of different libs, which may not be api/abi stable. This build depends on include-order, so that its files are found before the real libxcb headers.\r\n\r\nOur build (for other reasons related to qt's complicated build-system) injects our prefix into CXXFLAGS. Because libxcb is found in this path, that reverses the include-order, negating the purpose of the wrapper.\r\n\r\nTo fix, libxcb's includes are simply moved to a subdir. pkg-config ensures that they're still found properly when needed.\r\n\r\nTo make things even more interesting, this behavior in qt's .pro files is broken:\r\nINCLUDEPATH += $$QMAKE_CFLAGS_XCB\r\n\r\nThe INCLUDEPATH variable is processed by qmake which automatically prefixes each entry with \"-I\". The QMAKE_CFLAGS_XCB variable comes from pkg-config and already contains -I, making the path look like \"-I-I/path/to/xcb/headers\".\r\n\r\nTo work around that, CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS are used here rather than INCLUDEPATH.",
