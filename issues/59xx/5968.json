   "body" : "After the struct Consensus::Params was created in #5812, there are some redundant getters in CChainParams. \r\nThis is not the minimal way to remove it, but the fastest way would involve putting Params().GetConsensus() instead of params or params.GetConsensus().\r\nWith a few more extra changes we're going forward functions depending explicitly on CChainParams or Consensus::Params whenever it's possible.\r\n@sipa suggested removing the redundancies in #5812, this is what I meant by doing it later, better.\r\n@laanwj celebrated passing Consensus::Params as a parameter in that same PR, so I hope he likes this one too.\r\n@theuni will probably be interested in this one as well since he is working on similar things.\r\n",
