   "body" : "As of 0.10.0, Bitcoin.org began serving a torrent of all the release files.  Because the torrent uses web seeding, it had to have the same name as the directory holding the files, which was `0.10.0`.  @laanwj requested a more descriptive name in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/issues/748, so we renamed all the directories to `bitcoin-core-VERSION` and created redirects for old links.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the 0.10.1 release notes and release process documentation to use the `bitcoin-core-VERSION` directory natively from now on.  I also updated some other Bitcoin.org-related information in the release process to describe our current process.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need a separate PR to update the release process in master so these steps don't get forgotten.",
