   "body" : "Just add ``-proxy=crashme`` as parameter and on Windows and this will lead to an APPCRASH.\n\nI looked what that parameter causes, which is calling ``InitError()``, which aborts ``AppInit2()`` and causes a ``return 1;`` to exit the client.\n\nKnowing this I was placing a ``return false;`` in ``AppInit2()`` to see when the crash starts to occur. This is the case after the first ``bitdb.open()`` in Step 5 of the initialisation (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L587).\n\nI digged deeper into this and found out, that the crash is triggered in ``CDBEnv::EnvShutdown()`` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/db.cpp#L41), which is called when destroying the ``bitdb`` global. \n\nWhat I did not yet fully understand (because of a bad working Debugger), why would ``DbEnv(0).remove(GetDataDir().string().c_str()`` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/db.cpp#L41) cause this. Is it a problem with GetDataDir() or string()?\n\nAnyway, I have a fix ready, which prevents this crash #2024.\n\nPerhaps there is a better way to fix this, so core devs should take a look.",
