   "body" : "Pursuant to a \"discussion\" here:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2015\n\nThe patch does three things:\n1. Copies Qt frameworks from a well-known location.\n2, On my installation \"phonon\" plugin is called \"phonon_backend\". Make sure phonon_backend is ignored.\n3. env. variable QTDIR is used to find the plugins directory. On my installation the dir is \"/Developer/Application/Qt\". I decided that instead of hard-coding this path, setting QTDIR before running the script is a more flexible solution.",
