Qt Frameworks are in /Library/Frameworks\nThe strange thing is that the linker doesn't write the full path to the Qt Frameworks into the executable, like so:\n\notool -L ./Bitcoin-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/Bitcoin-Qt \n...<skip>...\nQtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui (compatibility version 4.6.0, current version 4.6.0)\nQtCore.framework/Versions/4/QtCore (compatibility version 4.6.0, current version 4.6.0)\n...<skip>...\n\nNote that there is no / in front of QtGui and QtCore.\nmacdeployqtplus apparently can't parse such a line and fails to deploy.\n\nMy suggestion would be to modify macdeployqtplus so that when encountering a path which starts with no \"/\" but with Qt*, macdeployqtplus prepends /Library/Frameworks.\nAlso macdeployqtplus can't find the plugins directory which by default is in  /Developer/Applications/Qt/Plugins",
