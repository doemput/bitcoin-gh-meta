Maybe it is a doc bug.\r\n\r\n-externalip=foo.onion (or Tor's OnionCat IPv6 /48)\r\n-externalip=bar.i2p (or I2P's GarliCat IPv6 /48)\r\n-externalip=6addr (.phantom / interpreted from its IPv6 /48 prefix)\r\n-externalip=6addr\r\n-externalip=4addr\r\n\r\nAlso, since socks context via -proxy breaks down with more than one such anonymous net, there would also need to be:\r\n-tor=host:port (in Tor, in bitcoin)\r\n-i2p=host:port (in I2P, not in bitcoin)\r\n-phantom=host:port (not in Phantom, not in bitcoin)\r\nand maybe\r\n-proxyipv4=host:port\r\n-proxyipv6=host:port",
