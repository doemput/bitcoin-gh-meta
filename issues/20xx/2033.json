On v0.7.1, it can be demonstrating by mining with 7e15b68ae applied. Every few hours, it seems such a transactions that conflicts with the memory pool gets mined (successful double spends?).\n\nFixing this results in less transactions in the memory pool, and faster construction of new blocks.\n\nThis should apply cleanly on v0.7.0, v0.7.1 and HEAD.",
