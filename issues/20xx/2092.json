Refer to pp:4.3.2 on page 19 of the\r\nspec for a quick picture.\r\n\r\nThere are also places in the code where the data logged contains\r\nand embedded timestamp in the line... that also needs to use ISO8601.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\r\nhttp://dotat.at/tmp/ISO_8601-2004_E.pdf",
