Any request after that fails, and I don't think there's any way to cancel the `waitfornewblock` requests.\r\n\r\nThere are also no tests for them and they are hidden debug RPCs, so it's likely you'd be the only one using them, which increases the risk of regressions.\r\n\r\nI'm slightly averse to long-polling RPCs in general, but I'm also not too concerned if these stay (with the provisos above).",
