We could adopt it and log events that take longer than a certain amount of time to be processed to get a better idea of where there are and aren't problems with blocking.\r\n\r\nAnother more sophisticated approach might be to add a new thread that monitors the event thread and dumps a stack trace of the event thread when it doesn't return from a handler fast enough.",
