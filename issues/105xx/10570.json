   "body" : "The current signrawtransaction rpc command is kind of a mess. It contains both wallet code and non-wallet code as well as an undocumented feature to combine multiple transactions. This issue is to track progress on this and to get some commentary on this split.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this is to result in the following (and probably in this order):\r\n- [x] Split combination of transactions into a new RPC that also handles the combination (#10571)\r\n- [x] Split `signrawtransaction` into wallet and non-wallet RPCs. (#10579)\r\n- [x] Mark `signrawtransaction` as deprecated (#10579)\r\n- [ ] Remove `signrawtransaction`",
