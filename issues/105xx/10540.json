   "body" : "Currently, the salvagewallet function sets the `DB_AGGRESSIVE` flag when calling BDB's `Db::verify()` and then tries to load the output back into a database. Here's the documentation for that flag:\r\n\r\n> Output all the key/data pairs in the file that can be found. By default, Db::verify() does not assume corruption. For example, if a key/data pair on a page is marked as deleted, it is not then written to the output file. When DB_AGGRESSIVE is specified, corruption is assumed, and any key/data pair that can be found is written. In this case, key/data pairs that are corrupted or have been deleted may appear in the output (even if the file being salvaged is in no way corrupt), and **the output will almost certainly require editing before being loaded into a database.**\r\n\r\nWe should not be setting the DB_AGGRESSIVE flag and then immediately trying to load the output into a database.\r\n\r\nFor more technical details see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7463#issuecomment-306336149.\r\n\r\nRunning with aggressive mode can lead to full database corruption and loss of private keys (#7379). The wallet is backed up to wallet.timestamp.bak, but the original wallet.dat file will lose some or all of its key-value pairs. That's obviously a very serious usability issue for users. Many will not know about the existence of the wallet.timestamp.bak backup files.\r\n\r\nI think in almost all cases it's better to run `Db::verify()` without the aggressive flag set. There perhaps should be a tool to run Db::verify() with the aggressive flag. If the database has been badly corrupted, it may be the only way to recover key-value pairs. However, this should be done in an external tool as the output will almost certainly require editing before being reloaded. #8745 (bitcoin-wallet-tool) is the right place for this.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the DB_AGGRESSIVE flag from calls to `Db::verify()`. It also re-enables the `-salvagewallet` incidental test in wallet.py. I've also included a commit which cleans up that test, which can be omitted if it's not wanted.\r\n\r\nI've run wallet.py 100 times and not yet hit the salvagewallet issue in #7463. That was intermittent, so I may just be getting lucky, but I think this is an improvement.\r\n\r\nFixes #7463 ",
