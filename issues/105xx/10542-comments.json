And it's a question if it's worth it.\r\n\r\nGot it. Thanks for the comments. Should I close the issue now?",

It could still be possible now I think.\r\n\r\nSince you have to recover pubkey from the signature right now, you can go to pubkeyhash and scripthash, given you somehow know the script format (in this case, p2sh-p2wpkh).\r\n\r\nThe signer would sign the message with his private key; the verifier would try that the pubkey in the signature generates the given address through p2sh, which would mean the signature is valid.\r\n\r\nThe only problem I can think of is that you are then proving both the ownership of the p2pkh and the p2s-p2wpkh addresses, but it doesn't really matter.",
