Then you can add the other transaction, and push it out to your peers too. ",

Indeed, having a similar concept for sendrawtransaction (or, really, the ability to send multiple transactions with one call) would be nice, but we probably need to fix the relay behavior (both from-sendrawtransaction and from-peers) to support it as well to make sure we dont accept transactions and then not succeed in relaying them anywhere.",
