   "body" : "Qt5.9 has been [released](http://blog.qt.io/blog/2017/05/31/qt-5-9-released/).\r\n\r\nNotable could be:\r\n\r\n`\r\nWith Qt 5.9, we have had a strong focus on performance and stability. WeÃ¢ÂÂve fixed a large number of bugs all across Qt[...]\r\n`\r\n\r\n`\r\nFinally, we added support for compiling Qt in a size optimized mode (-Os on GCC), saving around 5-20% in binary size for the Qt libraries and your applications.\r\n`\r\n\r\n`\r\nOne major decision we have taken is to make Qt 5.9 another long-term supported (LTS) release. The previous LTS release, Qt 5.6, is starting to show itÃ¢ÂÂs age, and many users have been asking for a more up to date version of Qt that they can use as a basis for long running projects.\r\n`",
