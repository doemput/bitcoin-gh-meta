   "body" : "I've run bitcoin-qt Mac client on the latest OSX version since 0.3.x thru to 0.7.2 with literally zero problems ever, on essentially this same hardware setup.\r\n\r\nSince the 0.8 update and switch to LevelDB none of the three Mac client releases have worked stably for me and I've had to downgrade to 0.7.2 (with the May 15 workaround) to maintain a stable bitcoin wallet.\r\n\r\nCurrent setup is: MacBook Pro Retina, OSX 10.8.4, bitcoin-qt 0.8.2\r\n\r\nI saw that some of the known corruption issues/bugs were fixed/closed with the 0.8.2 release, so I decided to try the upgrade again.  After re-indexing and working fine for hours at time (much better than 0.8.1 at least) upon restart I get \"Error opening block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database?\" which of course I don't want to do because it takes forever, even on this world's fastest Mac with SSD drive.  This has happened 6 times now, and the interesting line in debug.log is:\r\n\r\nVerifying last 288 blocks at level 3\r\nLevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch\r\n\r\nMore details here:\r\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155140.0\r\n\r\nDowngrading to 0.7.2 again, please help permanently fix this in the next 0.8.x release.",
