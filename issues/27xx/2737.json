   "body" : "It seems to me the Bitcoin-qt 'Sign Message' feature is a little harder to use than it should be.  Once all of the fields are filled in, it would be more convenient to output a block of text that contains all of the information that should be pasted in to a message.  Also a simple parser that expects this format should be put into the Verify Message side of things.\r\n\r\nIt's worth a note that Armory and MultiBit are working on this feature.  It would be nice if they all were compatible.\r\n\r\nHere's an example (taken from a PGP Signed message):\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nAddress:  1Bitcoinasdfasdfsadfsadfsadf\r\n\r\nBecause anyone can claim to be me. There's no validation of the user\r\nname or email address when someone posts a comment. While I do try to\r\nremove imposters, some may slip through. By signing my comments using\r\nthis technique, anyone can independently verify that I was the author of\r\nthe message by validating the signature.\r\n-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Bitcoin-qt (1.0)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFFxqRFCMEe9B/8oqERAqA2AJ91Tx4RziVzY4eR4Ms4MFsKAMqOoQCgg7y6e5AJIRuLUIUikjNWQIW\r\n-----END BITCOIN SIGNATURE-----",
