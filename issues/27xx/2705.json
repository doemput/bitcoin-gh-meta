It takes it as an unsigned int and attempts to resize it to 18 hexillion bytes, crashing with a std::bad_alloc, which is presented as \"bitcoin in Runaway exception\"\r\n\r\nThis pull simply adds a 'if ( dataSize < 0 ) dataSize = 0;' check before running resize(). Another option would be to make the resize() call itself conditional on dataSize being positive.",
