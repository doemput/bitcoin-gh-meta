   "body" : "After updating to 8.2 from 8.1 I can no longer start the Bitcoin-qt client. It always \"quits unexpectedly\". I tried un installing and re installing several times and with a couple of the past versions. When I tried 7.2 I could get the client to launch and the ctransactions all matched, however, I tried looking for the /Application Support/Bitcoin/ folder, and it's still missing. It seems like something is preventing the directory from being created during install..? I have my back up wallet.dat file else where and I did trying moving around but nothing seems to work.",
