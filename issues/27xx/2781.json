   "body" : "Refactor keytime:\r\n* Key metadata is kept in a CWallet::mapKeyMetadata (std::map< CKeyID, CKeyMetadata>).\r\n* When generating a new key, time is put in that map, and new key is written.\r\n* AddKeyPubKey and AddCryptedKey do not take a creation time argument, but instead\r\n  pull it from that map, if it exists there.\r\n\r\nBugfix:\r\n* AddKeyPubKey and AddCryptedKey in CWallet didn't override the CKeyStore\r\n  definition anymore. This is fixed, as they no longed need the nCreationTime\r\n  argument now.\r\n\r\nAlso a few related other changes:\r\n* Metadata can be overwritten.\r\n* Only GenerateNewKey calls GetTime(), as it's the only place where we know for\r\n  sure a key was not constructed earlier.\r\n* When the nTimeFirstKey is known to be inaccurate, it is set to the value 1\r\n  (instead of 0, which would mean unknown).\r\n* Use CPubKey instead of std::vector< unsigned char> where possible.\r\n\r\nFixes #2779 and #2780 \r\n",
