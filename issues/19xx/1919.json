   "body" : "The close button of the command line options window doesn't seem to work with Bitcoin-Qt 0.7.0 (and with a tarball from github I compiled a few days ago) on Ubuntu Lucid and Precise amd64. It simply has no effect at all. The issue is very easy to reproduce: just click Help > Debug Window > Command line options and you'll get the following window: ![Bitcoin command line options window](http://ompldr.org/vZnRvcQ/Bitcoin_command_line_window.gif)\r\n\r\nThen try to close the button by clicking on the usual \"X\" button. Only the OK button closes that window.\r\n\r\nAs as side remark, note that currently the \"OK\" and \"Show/Hide Details\" buttons do not seem to have i18n support. They are displayed in English with languages translated at 100% on Transifex. It may also be useful to give users the possibility to resize that window so that the listed options can be read more easily.",
