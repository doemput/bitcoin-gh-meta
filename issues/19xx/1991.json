In fact,\r\n        seeing all TXs tagged with the time at which they get included\r\n        in the blockchain makes more sense : in a way, it's the time the\r\n        TX became valid, and if we have to pick one canonically representative\r\n        time for a TX, first block inclusion time is better than first\r\n        broadcast time.\r\n\r\n",
