Garlicat requires a centralized lookup service to map the 80-bit addresses to fully routable ones (as far as I understood), so that's not really usable in our situation.\r\n\r\nTo support I2P routing and peer exchange for it, another solution is needed. This will most likely imply a network protocol change, and extension of the 'addr' message.\r\n\r\nRemove it for now, until we can support it completely.",
