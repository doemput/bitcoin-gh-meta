   "body" : "bitcoind should write to debug.log when it receives a shutdown signal so operator knows signal was sent while debugging/setup and for general logging.\r\n\r\n#### Story\r\nAs a new bitcoind operator, it was not evident to me why bitcoind was running so slow. This manifested in several ways:\r\n* RPC calls from localhost took 1-2 mins\r\n* uptime went through the roof\r\n* shutdown also took 1-2 mins\r\n\r\nI have since realized the obvious (now that I understand bitcoin better) that I'm still verifying my own block chain. *(This is taking freaking forever! I know I could use a lightweight...)*\r\n\r\n#### Rational\r\nWhat I've proposed is a simple change that would significantly help new users and ensure proper logging of significant events.\r\n\r\nIf debug.log had printed a trivial message that it had started it's shutdown process, I wouldn't have been pulling my hair out trying to figure out why killing it was doing nothing. *(I was watching tail -f debug.log)*\r\n\r\n###### Related note\r\nAdding to debug.log that the local blockchain is behind by more than ~2 blocks and that some time may be required to catch up would also be very useful, especially for people unfamiliar with bitcoin[d].",
