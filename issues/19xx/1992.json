OpenSSL provides the safe\r\nOPENSSL_cleanse() function in crypto.h, which perfectly does the job of\r\nclean and overwrite data.\r\n\r\nFor details see: http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0178/\r\n\r\n- change memset() to OPENSSL_cleanse() where appropriate\r\n- change a hard-coded number from netbase.cpp into a sizeof()\r\n\r\nThere are still some more memset() calls in the code, perhaps a dev should take a look if I missed any, that is related to this pull!",
