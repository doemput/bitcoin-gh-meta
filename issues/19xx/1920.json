One line was drawing my attention:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n10/11/12 20:10:57 Default data directory C:\\Users\\Diapolo\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\r\n10/11/12 20:10:57 Used data directory 10/11/12 20:10:57\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSeems like ``pszDataDir`` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L483) does NOT contain what it should print there. I currently have no time to investigate, but to me this seems to be a problem with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L443.\r\n\r\n(RC1 does not include #1901, which could be a cause? - As the build is from 2012-10-09 it is not :-D.) Perhaps the call to ``GetDataDir()`` with ``.string().c_str()`` attached causes a problem, because it's the first one (caching issue), I dunno.",
