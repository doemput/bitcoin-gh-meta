(See attachment)\nI am using bitcoin core since version 0.12.1 and until now I took the ready compiled programs (for linux 64bit).\nThus I compiled the \"infinity-patch\" (for version 0.14.0) nowadays for the first time and I saw a warning resulting from comparison of variables \"signed int\" and \"unsigned int\". \nThis may be harmless, but it can give problems if it is possible to change the contents of such variables at runtime (what I do not know).\n\nCheers,\n\nDrehschloss\n\n\nThursday, march 23rd 2017, 23:48:05 paveljanik wrote:\n> We do not have such code in our tree.
