Then also `dumpprivkey`.\r\n\r\nAfter moving files around and restarting with Wallet-2: `importprivkey` and also `addwitnessaddress` which gives me the same P2SH-enclosed witness address as Wallet-1, I need to rescan the blockchain for the wallet to update.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to wallet-rescan from bitcoin-cli? or some behavior similar to `importprivkey rescan=true`?",
