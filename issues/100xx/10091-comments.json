This would be a great improvement.\r\nIdeally we create a structure that contains all available configuration options with help-information, rules how they depend/interact with other options.\r\nA check for invalid options during startup would be good. The only downside might be that an older version with a newer configuration (or vice versa) could break the startup (in case we stop the startup process).",

The other way around should usually work, but if we do remove or rename command line arguments it's better if the user is made aware of that. And some arguments could be explicitly ignored in some cases.",
