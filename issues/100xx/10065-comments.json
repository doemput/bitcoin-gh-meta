A pretty easy way now is to spray it with a bunch of dust. Then if who ever owns 17p47toGLR5zBZw2pNzRDFh9yWKX2qxyaJ is running a wallet like bitcoin core, it'll automatically spend link all that dust. Eventually I should be able to figure out who owns that address, especially if it's a service. And thus where you were sending your money.\r\n\r\nThat's a pretty big privacy hole that should be disable-able.",
