It also make review easier.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we only have two usages of ```ends_with```, in core_read.cpp and netbase.cpp.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 usages of ```starts_with``` (the 16 in leveldb/ don't count) in bitcoind.cpp, core_read.cpp, netbase.cpp, wallet/rpcdump.cpp and util.cpp as you've removed here.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest updating this PR to remove all usages of both. Then please update the PR title, and drop [trivial].\r\n",
