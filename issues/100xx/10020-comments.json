Note that there is some mitigation for this by randomizing the nLockTime in one of then cases:\r\n```c++\r\n    // Secondly occasionally randomly pick a nLockTime even further back, so\r\n    // that transactions that are delayed after signing for whatever reason,\r\n    // e.g. high-latency mix networks and some CoinJoin implementations, have\r\n    // better privacy.\r\n    if (GetRandInt(10) == 0)\r\n        txNew.nLockTime = std::max(0, (int)txNew.nLockTime - GetRandInt(100));\r\n```\r\nSo up-to-date nodes will occasionally send older locktimes as well.\r\n\r\nThere might be additional privacy improvements possible, of course.",
