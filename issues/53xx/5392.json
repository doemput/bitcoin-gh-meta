There are also more minor logging and bitcoin-tx references.\r\n\r\nBasically, the goal was to just remove the \"OP_\" prefixes.\r\n\r\n1) Example P2PKH\r\nBefore:\r\nOP_DUP OP_HASH160 b9c670c7aa955c9808af7eeb9643b9fd6285cbf5 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\r\nAfter:\r\nDUP HASH160 b9c670c7aa955c9808af7eeb9643b9fd6285cbf5 EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG\r\n\r\n2) Example P2SH\r\nBefore:\r\nOP_HASH160 2a5edea39971049a540474c6a99edf0aa4074c58 OP_EQUAL\r\nAfter:\r\nHASH160 2a5edea39971049a540474c6a99edf0aa4074c58 EQUAL\r\n\r\nIf these changes gain acceptance, I'll add some release notes too when that time comes.",
