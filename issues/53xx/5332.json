That would be harmless unless the .a was built in a way that\r\nwould break linking, like non-fpic.\r\n\r\nWhat we really want is \"-static\" here. Despite its name, it's actually less\r\naggressive than -static-libtool-libs. It causes only internal libs to be linked\r\nstatically (libbitcoinconsensus is the one were'a after).",
