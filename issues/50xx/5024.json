Extract the .dmg and then the .app from the .dmg\r\n3. Re-run macdeployqtplus -sign using the extracted, deterministic .app to create a code-signed app inside a .dmg that is actually released.\r\n\r\nStep 3 broke with OSX 10.9.5, because symbolic links inside the .app were not preserved. This fixes that.\r\n\r\n@laanwj : this should be cherry-picked to the 0.9.3 branch in case there is a 0.9.4.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to change the code-signing process to something like:\r\n\r\n1. Code-signer gitian builds first, producing a .osx.tar.gz that has a .dmg that is signed.\r\n2. Everybody else uses the signatures produced in (1) as an input to the gitian-building process and verifies that end results match.\r\n",
