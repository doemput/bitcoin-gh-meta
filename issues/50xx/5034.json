Untested though, because I can't reproduce with my version of mingw.\r\n\r\nNewer mingw supports the features necessary to enable this api, whereas older\r\nversions didn't. However once enabled (automatically by configure), it triggers\r\nan unrelated build bug.\r\n\r\nSince it was not enabled previously anyway, and we don't depend on the\r\nfunctionality, just disable it across the board.",
