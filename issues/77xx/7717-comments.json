      "body" : "In #7723 I made the build system invoked scripts compatible with both Python2 and Python3.\r\n\r\nFor the build system I think it's good to have both Python2 and Python3 compatibility (annoying to have specific dependencies there). This is not necessary for the other python scripts, such as the RPC tests. For practical reasons it's ok to have an explicit Python 2.7 dependency for those - though we'll have to document that in the invocation instructions.\r\n\r\nPorting the non-build-system Python scripts in one go to Python3, without intermediate Python 2 and 3 compatibility phase is a better use of our time. We'll have to decide when, though. Like the c++11 change, it's probably something some people feel very strongly about.\r\n",

I'm guessing something in the desktop version requires Python 2, as I didn't manually install it.\r\n\r\nIn any event, I'm glad to hear that work is progressing on upgrading the tests to Python 3. Having compatibility for both is good but, as mentioned in the meeting yesterday, maintaining compatibility is extra work. As long as there's no supported environment that's Py2-only, I say take the path of least resistance. Just keep in mind that the 2-to-3 script out there (or at least the one we used to create a Py3 Armory prototype) is a bit buggy. Hopefully manual intervention will be kept to a minimum.",
