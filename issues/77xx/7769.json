But I was reading over the code trying to figure out why the fee estimates in 0.12 are seemingly such over-estimates, and can't find in the logic anywhere it would ignore empty blocks?\r\n\r\nBy empty block, I mean something like:\r\nhttps://www.blocktrail.com/btc/block/404921\r\n\r\nwhich is probably pretty useless for fee estimation purposes, and contributing to the effect that bitcoin can never estimate the fees required for 1 confirmation.",
