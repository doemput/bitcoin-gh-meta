Also realize that a client may need this value to process further, not to show to the user: e.g. bitwise-AND operations should be done on a number, not a string, so this change may mean doing an *extra* conversion from hex to int on the client side.\r\n\r\nNo strong opposition to adding it as extra field, though I'd still say adding a field to avoid an extra hex conversion on the client side is too much hand-holding. This shouldn't set a precedent to add hex, octal, binary for every field.\r\n",

I wanted to avoid redundancy for the easy to ascertain version numbers that are definitely treated as integers.\r\n\r\nI was trying to avoid being too specific to BIP9 because it allows for two future mechanisms (top bits 010 and 011). I thought of using `>= VERSIONBITS_TOP_BITS`, but that ignores [5, 0x1fffffff] which I think could be re-purposed too. I don't see any rule limiting that range's use to only being simple integers.\r\n\r\nI should probably just keep it simple and always display `versionHex`. My redundancy limiting kinda feels like unnecessary optimization.",
