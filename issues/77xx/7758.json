I don't think this is happening at all.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, but I could be confused, is that this is a problem as it means different transactions in the same position with the same outputs will potentially result in the same hash.\r\n\r\nAnother slight issue (but more of a naming/documentation one) is that `nSerializedSize` is confusing: it's not the size of the data hashed to `hashSerialized`, but a differently computed quantity.\r\n",
