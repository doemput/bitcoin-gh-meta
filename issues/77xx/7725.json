   "body" : "Version 0.12.0 is unusable for me on Windows 10. I started using it shortly after it came out & after downloading hundreds of GB in that time, it's never gotten the blockchain caught up to live. The problem is not my computer's performance (i7-2600 @ 3.7GHz, 16GB RAM & multiple SSD drives). I have tried on this PC & a laptop (who's non-SSD hard drive ended up failing from all the thrashing). I have tried starting from a clean %HOME%/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin directory multiple times and it takes dozens of hours to download and in that time, closes unexpectedly (with no indication except it's no longer running) or crashes, corrupting the blockchain requiring a restart from scratch, or an equivalently lengthy reindex.\r\n\r\nI'm now using git to version control my %HOME%/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin so that I can restore the blockchain when it crashes and requires reindex. But that's extremely tedious and inefficient (yet faster than letting bitcoin attempt to reindex).\r\n\r\nAnd today, I tried to uninstall it and reinstall v0.11.2 (which did not suffer from this). But when I run it, Windows says that the program exited unexpectedly, with no other information useful for troubleshooting. So, I just have to put up with this extraordinary inefficiency from now on? What? Do you not want people to use bitcoin anymore?",
