But when I run it, Windows says that the program exited unexpectedly, with no other information useful for troubleshooting. \r\n\r\nDid you follow the downgrade instructions that specifically say you must run with -reindex?\r\n\r\n> Do you not want people to use bitcoin anymore?\r\n\r\nNone of the current Bitcoin Core developers (AFAIK) use Windows, and it gets tested mainly by users during the release-candidate stage. So until someone reports a Windows-specific issue, we probably won't know about it.",
