There's an option per end-point.\r\n\r\nI think it's bad practice to depend on default settings (\"guess\") for more than one thing used to find the instance. Such information should be available for query from there on.\r\n\r\n> Instead of querying the url configured at command line, the client could request the start of notification and specify the url.\r\n\r\nWell, yes, that'd be an option. But zmq already has subscribe/unsubscribe logic of itself. I don't like adding another, mandatory, layer at the bitcoind side. The user can just configure zmq once in bitcoin.conf and then applications can use it.\r\n\r\nIn any case that would be the symmetric option \"configure zmq endpoints through RPC\". Not opposed to that, but for this purpose I'd just like to query already-configured ones. See #7289 if you're interested in configuring things through RPC.\r\n\r\nBTW I'd personally like an option `-zmqpuball=<endpoint>` that configures *all* notification types to the same endpoint. The reason that this doesn't exist is that some notifications are expensive (I think actually only the full block one, which reads a block from disk and re-serializes it) which is a waste if no one is listening.\r\n",
