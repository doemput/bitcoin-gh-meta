   "body" : "This is a demo combination of #6452, #6421, #6453 and a new gradual relay fee adjustment.\r\n\r\nContinuously (every second) adjust the relay fee by measuring the mempool size and correcting it towards 71% (sqrt(50%)) of the cap size. The maximum correction speed is equal to doubling or halving the fee per two hours. The relay fee will never go below the -minrelayfee setting. It is not intended to deal with sudden spikes - that's what the hard cap is meant for.\r\n\r\nThis was inspired by Jeff Garzik's low/high water mark approach, but has more gradual effects.\r\n\r\nTODO: integration with fee estimation. @morcos, feel like having a look at that?",
