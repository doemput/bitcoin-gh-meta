Feedback from people that have been working on alternative replacement policies (for example, @petertodd and @luke-jr ) or people that are working on the mempool is specially welcomed. \r\n@morcos I'm thinking that the new CTxMemPool::addUnchecked that removes conflicts before inserting the new transaction may need some call the the fee estimator, but I'm not certain yet. What do you think?\r\n",
