Reported via mail:\r\n\r\n> Can you, if you can, enable all accessibility features in core\r\n> client? Version 0.11 is not accessible especially in MacOs and Linux,\r\n> the last accessible version for these osses is 0.9.X. The last version\r\n> is accessible in Windows platform, but I prefer Mac to Windows. Can you\r\n> enable accessibility features for screen reader support? If you want, I\r\n> can test it with my iMac and Ubuntu laptop.\r\n\r\n> In windows, all accessibility features are working, but after upgrading\r\n> to qt 5, the accessibility features didn't work in Mac and Linux. IN\r\n> Linux and Mac, I can hear window names only, for example when BitCoin\r\n> core is launched for a first time, I can hear welcome, but I can't\r\n> navigate the radio buttons and buttons for selecting, where to use\r\n> BitCoin folder. If I have prepared folder from Windows, I can hear Bit\r\n> Con Core, but I can not navigate the app. In Mac, I can navigate menus\r\n> only, in Linux, I can do nothing. So try to check qt-at-spi integration\r\n> and other accessibility modules / accessibility vidgets, but maybe there\r\n> is a problem with the accessibility module in qt 5 mac / linux version.\r\n> If the team changes something, in accessibility, please let me know and\r\n> I will test changes and report it.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this improved with the switch to Qt 5.5.\r\n",
