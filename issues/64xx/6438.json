Also [the source](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_0_0-stable/crypto/conf/conf_sap.c) is self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nSince we don't use any loadable functionality, I don't see how this could hurt. Presumably qt tries to load available modules, but the fallbacks should always work.\r\n\r\nOne last data point: The depends build is trying to load ```/home/ubuntu/build/bitcoin/depends/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/etc/openssl/openssl.cnf``` which obviously won't be found in the end-user's environment. So this functionality has actually been disabled for a long time anyway.",
