That would allow (for ex) a different blocksize or flagday on testnet so that we could test before the real thing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think we could avoid a good bit of competing proposals if we pulled in a generic version of this that just parametrizes things as necessary to make the block size dynamic. It'd then just be a matter of debating what ```MaxBlockSize(uint64_t nBlockTimestamp)``` does internally.\r\n\r\nWe could even go as far as making it:\r\n```uint64_t MaxBlockSize(uint64_t nBlockTimestamp) { (void)nBlockTimestamp; return 1000000; }```\r\nfor now, which should be 100% uncontentious, and could be merged immediately.\r\n\r\nAny real blocksize changes would then be very straightforward in code.",

Furthermore with this pull-req every block mined on the original Bitcoin chain acts to 51% \"attack\" the Garzik chain; you *can't* mine original Bitcoin without participating in that 51% \"attack\".\r\n\r\nNote how the normal nVersion supermajority soft-fork mechanism is explicitly designed so that once 95% support is reached, that overwhelming majority \"attacks\" the 5% minority, ensuring that users still on the 5% minority only see the secure, 95% majority chain. Equally, the Bitcoin Core software is designed to allow that \"attack\" to happen, because with a 95% majority we'd prefer to go along. (the definition of a soft-fork!)",

Is that true? It has typically been characterized as merely a static bump to 2MB, but it actually seems to be: 2 + x , where x = number of years after activation. -- This would mean BIP102 is similar to BIP248 in years 0-2, more conservative in years 2-4, and thereafter slightly more aggressive in the longterm (infinitely increasing by 1MB/year).\r\n\r\nAlso, is it advisable to include a fix for amaclin's sigop attack (needs hard fork to properly fix) in BIP102? I know pork-barreling a hard fork with too many things isn't advisable, but perhaps exceptions should be made for security fixes and such high-priority items.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

This would require 9 different values, i.e. vote size same/up/down, delay same/up/down. I'd suggest 12.5% increases or decreases. This way the miners can tune as they require, and they are the main people with the incentive to make it sustainable (is this a correct assumption?) \r\n\r\nI've reserved bitcoinmv.com (MV stands for Miner Vote) as a potential fork to the bitcoin project to give people another option in addition to Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, etc...

Just make sure that about 20% abstains until 75% is met and you are golden. \r\n\r\nOr 40% of miners can abstain until 55% is reached, or 30% can abstain until 65% is reached. Take your pick. \r\n\r\nA majority of miners is in control over the activation anyway. It is just easier to increase the effective activation percentage than it is to lower it. Because lowering needs a completely new software release, new version numbers, or it needs miners to orphan votes which abstain for nefarious reasons. \r\n\r\nGiving a minority some kind of veto is very dangerous and irresponsible. Obviously a minority (which aligns with preventing such a change) isn't going to admit that when that means losing the power to force things upon the majority with this inaction. \r\n\r\nYou go drive a bus with 100 passengers, and then when 5 people disagree with the direction you stop steeing completely. Clearly inaction is always better. Forcing \"not steering\" upon 95% makes total sense. \r\n\r\nFor non contentious non time sensitive issues a 95% activation percentage is fine, as that means the majority of miners don't have to do any coordination amongst themselves to safely activate the soft/hard fork. But if there is any significant cost to not upgrading or not upgrading on time **and** there is a chance that not everyone is going to upgrade in time (for whatever reason) then a 75% activation percentage gives you **way** more flexibility. It is a nice number, not too high, not too low. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
