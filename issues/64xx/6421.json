The DoS protection relay rules then operate on the size of both the new transaction and the removed ones (as pointed out by @lapp0 in #6281).\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n* Even though it adds a feerate index to the mempool, it does not use this index for block construction.\r\n* The mempool eviction code does not take priority into account. It strictly aims at maximizing mempool fee rate.\r\n* Untested.",
