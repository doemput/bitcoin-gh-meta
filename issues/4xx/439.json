   "body" : "This patch does two bug fixing things and has two documentation corrections:\r\n\r\nbug fix 1) It allows 32bit builds to write to debug.log past 2GB. I need someone to test this on *bsd and win32.\r\nbug fix 2) Change GetFilesize to use stat() instead of fseek() to prevent an integer overflow that would prevent >2GB debug.logs from getting trimmed on most (any?) platforms. This function is only currently called by ShrinkDebugFile which has been updated to pass a string instead of a FILE*.\r\n\r\ndocumentation update) Add -logtimestamps and -printtoconsole to -? output.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested with:\r\n\r\n dd if=/dev/zero of=debug.log bs=$((1024 * 1024)) count=2048; tail -f debug.log & bitcoind -daemon;\r\n\r\nIf logs get appended to where debug.log continues past 2GB it is working. Must be tested on a 32bit build.\r\n\r\ndebug.log should also no longer be truncated on startup as that should be left to the user. This can be tested by restarting bitcoind after the fact and ensuring it is not truncated.\r\n\r\nThe additional help output is pretty straight forward to test: is it there? :)",
