If this is correct, then it might be problematic and could result in a loss of funds to miners. When miners mine more than one block using the same payout address, the coinbase transactions in each block are identical, which results in them having an identical sha256 hash, which results in all but the first one being unidentifiable and hence unspendable. I suppose you might be aware of that, but wanted to point this out just to prevent the possibility of it being an expensive consequence for somebody else.",
