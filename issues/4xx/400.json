   "body" : "I have used EncFS and MacFUSE to encrypt my \"~/Library/Application Support\" directory on MacOS X (10.6.8).  I'm attempting to use the latest version (0.3.23) of the official client.  However, when I attempt to start the client, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEXCEPTION: 22DbRunRecoveryException\r\nDbEnv::open: DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run\r\ndatabase recovery\r\nbitcoin in AppInit()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy experimentation, I have found that the trouble file is `wallet.dat`.  All the other files can be encrypted without a problem.  The exact encryption scheme is that Application Support is symlinked to ~/.crypt/Library/Application Support, where ~/.crypt is an EncFS mount.  Other applications work fine with this (with the notable exception of the App Store).\r\n\r\nThis happens both with a clean startup and a pre-existing wallet.",
