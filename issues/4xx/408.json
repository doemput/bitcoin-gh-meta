   "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\n \"A new address does automatically get generated but no it doesn't get added to the addressbook.\" - Stephen Gornick\r\n\r\n  I have two Bitcoin clients running on two different computers:\r\n\r\n Computer A: Bitcoin 0.3.23\r\n Computer B: fresh installed Bitcoin 0.3.24\r\n\r\n But the new Bitcoin 0.3.24 does not behave the way it did before... I mean, I sent B$0.01 two times, from Computer A (0.3.23) to Computer B (0.3.24) but, at the Bitcoin 0.3.24, NO NEW ADDRESS automatically appeared at \"my receiving address\" in the AddressBook (I can see the new address at the main interface screen, but no anywhere else)! But it happens in Bitcoin 0.3.23...\r\n\r\n Where can I manage/see my automatically generated new Bitcoin Addresses?\r\n\r\n Reference:\r\n http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=28343.0\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nThiago",
