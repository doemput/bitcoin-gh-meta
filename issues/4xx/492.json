   "body" : "This change skips ECDSA signature verification for transactions during the initial block-chain download, which makes downloading the block chain much faster.\r\n\r\n\"Initial block chain download\" is all blocks up to 120 blocks before the last blockchain lock-in point.\r\n\r\nReasoning for why this is safe:\r\n\r\nIf an attacker tries to feed a client bad transactions during the initial block-chain download (transactions with invalid signatures), then they change the merkle tree, and at the first blockchain lock-in the bad chain will be rejected.\r\n\r\nTransactions are still checked for orphan blocks that come in during initial block-chain-download (ConnectInputs will be called with fBlock=FALSE) and for mined blocks (ConnectInputs called with fMiner=TRUE).\r\n",
