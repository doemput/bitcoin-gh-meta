The wallet flush on shutdown can block disk i/o for several seconds.\r\n\r\nLonger term, it may be worth thinking about changing bitcoind LogPrints to write to a circular buffer and have a background thread write from there to disk. For now, let's just make this test less flakey.\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar ",
