Each time you do, that address is marked dirty and any UTXOs pointing to it are automatically considered dirty in this implementation. Am I missing a case?\r\n\r\n> Also, shouldn't rescanning be sufficient?\r\n\r\nOops - yes, rescanning is sufficient. Updated OP, thanks.\r\n\r\nEdit: my definition of address reuse has always been \"spending from the same address 2+ times\", whereas @luke-jr's definition seems to be \"any UTXOs which send to an address that has already been sent to\". Both definitions would solve the issue in question, but the latter would mean people could no longer say \"to support my work send BTC to [static address]\" if they wished to use this feature. The question ultimately is \"which one of the two definitions makes the most sense?\"\r\n",

      "body" : "I support the goal, but:  If an address is paid 10 btc then 0.0001 btc  and then a transaction spends the latter, A would be dirty and the 10 BTC are stuck.  That seems sub-optimal.\r\n\r\nThe best idea I had to deal with that previously is that whenever you spend from A you make an effort to spend all payments to A or at least all non-dust payments to A.  Then the only time you get dirty funds is when someone pays a non-negligible amount to an address after you've already spent to it. \r\n\r\nIf something is going to cause transactions to fail, we probably will need another kind of balance display to make the behavior explicable.\r\n\r\nIndependently from this (but also useful for it) we probably should have an icon in the transaction list for reused addresses. (Trefoil made of arrows? :P )\r\n",

The intention of this is to give expert users a way to plug the gaping security hole that exists in the system -- to make it intuitive and wonderful for the average user is not an aspiration at this point (as mentioned, in particular RPC commands need some work before this could ever be made a default-on feature). \r\n\r\nThe solutions you present are all solutions an expert user could make use of with this implementation. It would simply stop their clients from shooting them (privacy wise) in the foot automatically.\r\n\r\nEdit: Re-reading, I realize you are talking about coin select algorithm. That's an interesting idea. It would make sense to consider all \"coins\" going to A as a single coin for as long as you haven't spent from A yet. That way you select on an all-or-nothing basis (perhaps excluding dust).",
