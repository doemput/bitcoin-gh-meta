Send 0.01 BTC to another wallet; use transaction fee suggestions:\r\n2. Set suggestion the the highest point where the lowest amount is suggested.\r\nExample: If the lowest rate is: 26k Satoshi / kB at 4hours but it still is 26k Satoshi at 3 hours but 1 higher more would be suggested, set it to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nTransaction conformations should for real start roughly at the suggested times +- 20%.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nTransactions that used low fees when the load was low don't get confirmed after the suggested time if load increased. I now wait for 27 hours for my 0.01 BTC to start being confirmed at 26k Satoshi / kB, which was a suggestion where was displayed that the transaction confirmation should start within the next 2 hours!\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nBitcoin Core Version v0.14.1 (64-Bit) - Provided by developers, not self compiled.\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Win 10\r\n",
