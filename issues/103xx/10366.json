   "body" : "Another take at #9876 (I didn't realize it existed, but it's closed and I really do think we should get rid of `import *`s if possible!).\r\n\r\nMain difference that I can see: each commit corresponds to one file.\r\n\r\nI attempted to pull imported imports out as much as possible, e.g. instead of importing `Decimal` from `util.py`, it is now imported directly from `decimal`. I may have missed some of these.\r\n\r\nOptions, please advice:\r\n1. Discard this PR as redundant in favor of outcome in discussion in #9876 (`__all__`) -- personally I don't think this approach is ideal, as it breeds bad behavior from example (`import *` *is* considered bad behavior, even if `__all__` makes it more controllable) -- or in favor of reopening #9876.\r\n2. Split into multiple PR's to spread impact out over time, e.g. \"p2p-*, mempool_*, ...\".\r\n3. Take as is or squashed in some fashion (p2p-*, mempool_*, ...)\r\n",
