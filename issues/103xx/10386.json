   "body" : "#10065 brings up a privacy issue where a user can send a bunch of near-dust transactions to an address, which would be picked up by the coin select code when the owner funded transactions, connecting multiple transactions and addresses to the same user.\r\n\r\nThis adds a (by default turned off) flag `-avoidreuse` to Bitcoin. When enabled, the wallet will mark any addresses that were used to fund a transaction as \"dirty\" and will avoid using them in funding additional transactions, unless an \"allow dirty\" flag is set.\r\n\r\nIt also adds support to allow dirty addresses to `sendtoaddress`. More tweaks to other RPC commands is necessary but I wanted to keep the PR as small as possible.\r\n\r\nRetroactive flagging of dirty addresses can be done by rescanning the chain.",
