I would personally like the following columns:\r\n\r\n* Debit\r\n* Fee\r\n* Net amount\r\n* TxID\r\n* Number of recipients\r\n* Number of inputs\r\n* Number of confirmations (right now this is rendered as a graphical indicator combined with a tooltip)\r\n* A button column \"Copy transaction details to clipboard\". This is useful for copying out all of the data to document the transaction in some other place.\r\n* Maybe a text comment for the transaction in addition to the label (which is meant to be short)\r\n\r\nI am always unsure what the \"Amount (BTC)\" column means. It would help to have all three amount-based columns available. Right now I have to open the transaction details to find those values.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are other data that can be exposed for power users as well.",
