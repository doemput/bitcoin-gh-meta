   "body" : "abandonconflict.py intermittently fails (about 1 time out of 25 for me). The failure is caused by a race between shutting down node0 and a transaction being INV'ed from node0 and getting into node1's mempool.\r\n\r\nThe original intent was that node0 and node1 should be disconnected before sending the transaction in node0. However, the call to `disconnectnode()` doesn't actually disconnect the nodes because there are two P2P connections between node0 and node1 (`connect_nodes_bi()` madness).\r\n\r\nThis PR change the direct call to `disconnectnode()` into a call to the test_framework/util function `disconnect_nodes()` which fully disconnects the nodes. It also asserts that node1's mempool is empty after stop-starting node0.\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt ",
