It's often useful to have the system time in the logs (for example, when running an integration test, it's useful to know what bitcoind was doing at system time so you can see how it's interacting with the test framework or other bitcoind nodes).\r\n\r\nThis PR timestamps the log with the actual system time, and also prints out the mocktime if mocktime is being used.\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar ",
