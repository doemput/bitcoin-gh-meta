   "body" : "The `CTransaction&()` operator in `CMerkleTx` makes conversion into `CTransaction`s transparent, but was marked as to-be-removed in favor of explicitly getting the `tx` ivar, presumably as the operator can lead to ambiguous behavior and makes the code harder to follow.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the operator and adapts callers. This includes some cases of `static_cast<CTransaction>(wtx)` Ã¢ÂÂ `*wtx.tx`, which is definitely an improvement.\r\n",
