The thought was more that hashing a block is so much simpler than connecting a block, that you would not actually see any measurable increase in runtime performance from this change.",

Thoughts?\r\n\r\nImplicit caching, although the explicit code impact is smaller, is always somewhat error-prone. I think I prefer explicitly passing values in.\r\n\r\nBut if this isn't worth doing, we should simply not do it. Unnecessary changes are only a risk.\r\nClosing.\r\n",
