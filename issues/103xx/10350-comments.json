The alternatives of either maintaining a custom server (one more thick dependency) or using RPC (excruciatingly and impractically slow and inefficient) aren't really options for me at this point. So until we do something like clientside block filtering I'm left with either using this patch or having to hack something up that's really ugly on my end.\r\n\r\nI understand that there's a desire to not pollute the codebase with stuff that most people probably will not use - so I fully understand if other devs are reluctant to want to merge this. But I do not believe it is particularly intrusive - it doesn't really get in the way of anyone else and is easy to review and test for correctness. And it would save at least some people a nontrivial amount of additional effort in having to maintain separate branches and patches.\r\n\r\nI'm eager to contribute to the effort of finding a good long-term solution to the thin client sync issue and helping to implement it. But right now I need to make some important software releases, and the more I need to worry about my own software's short-term compatibility issues the less I can focus on the bigger picture.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I appreciate the consideration.",
