   "body" : "This issue follows the [discussion from here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7664#issuecomment-230359114).\r\n\r\nCore currently does an exact match to check if it should omit the change output when creating a transaction. However the correct logic should be to have a little of leeway, donating extra money to miners if required.\r\n\r\n(This is because creating a change output itself isn't free, you need to pay the extra bytes in the transaction, and in the future source that change output at least paying `relayfee`).\r\n\r\nSo instead of an exact match against `amount == target` it should check if it's `amount >= target && amount < target + sizeof(a_change_output) * fee_rate + sizeof(sourcing_that_change) * relayFee).\r\n\r\nThis has the benefit of improving coin selection, but most importantly it will hugely improve privacy for bitcoin users as it'll break a lot of the wallet clustering logic that identifies change outputs.\r\n\r\nI (bustabit.com) am offering a 1 btc bounty if this gets merged in within 90 days.",
