(As dust is defined as it would cost 1/3 the outputs value in fees to spend.). I think my original formula would make more sense.\r\n\r\niirc a dust amount now is like 7000 satoshis? Seems a fair bit too aggressive, but not outrageous (considering most people would want to source that output at a high feerate, not at the relayrate)",
