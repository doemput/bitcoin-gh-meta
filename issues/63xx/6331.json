   "body" : "This patch changes CTxMemPool::mapTx from a std::map to a boost::multi_index_container.\r\n\r\nThe container has three indexes:\r\n- Tx Hash\r\n- Fee Rate (fee-per-kb) - ordered from highest to lowest\r\n- Priority (at current chain height) - ordered from highest to lowest\r\n\r\nThe idea is that these indices can later be used for:\r\n- Creating blocks\r\n- Mempool eviction\r\n\r\nThe priority stuff is a bit ugly, so suggestions on alternate designs are welcome.  I would also like to add another test case that tests the ConnectTip/DisconnectTip triggers, but I need to do some more work to figure out how to construct such a test.",
