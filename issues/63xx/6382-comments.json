But this also allows you to simulate networks with smaller sizes and to test schism forks scenarios.\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt what about the individual steps (to make things like this more maintainable on top of master)?

Then it prepares code for a future change in block size and then it adds a new testchain to test different block sizes. The last part only makes sense if it is a single extremely simple commit like  https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/b7bce5c5571200361e3b74406d0f9bc986960491 . But even if that change is never accepted, I will maintain it here because that's the way I test \"is it easy to create a new testchain?\" every time I rebase. I have marked that step as nacked and solved in the first post. I have also properly marked the PRs that are currently closed and opened #6907 and #6908 which are now much more clear after #6235.\r\nPeople interested in changes to make it easier to create new testchains can follow this PR and I can rebase just one long branch plus only a few little opened PRs at a time.\r\nWhen there's only nacked commits remaining we can revisit the nacks and merge or close. This was never intended to be merged all at once, that's why it has the bullet points (which I'm finding very useful). \r\nIn the meantime, it is more useful to look at this just to \"see the big picture\", while we focus review on the few open PRs this depends on.",
