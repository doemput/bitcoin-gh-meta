But I would like your feedback on the factory and the container (which are shared with #6068 ).\r\nThis is blocking #6229 and #5229. \r\nEDIT:\r\nThe fixup commit cleaning up the includes ~~may make more sense after more of #5970 (for example, #6163, we're not that far away from making miner.cpp independent from the chainparams globals)~~ is left for later.\r\n",
