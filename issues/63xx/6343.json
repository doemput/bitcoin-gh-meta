The following changes would need to be made first by someone else (@theuni?):\r\n\r\n* `gitian-win.yml` would need to be changed to output one single tarball with everything needed for the signing, as in the OS X process\r\n  * `gitian-win-signer.yml` would need to be changed to use said tarball\r\n* `gitian-win.yml` would need to be changed to include -unsigned in the installer file names",
