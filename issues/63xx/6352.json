On testnet/regtest full-RBF is always supported.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is from my full-RBF patch series, specifically https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/replace-by-fee-v0.11.0rc2, with additional logic and tests from #6176 \r\n\r\nBIP: https://github.com/petertodd/bips/blob/bip-full-rbf-deadline/bip-full-rbf-deadline.mediawiki\r\n\r\nCredit goes to @jgarzik for suggesting a scheduled-in-advance deployment strategy.",
