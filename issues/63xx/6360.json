Could a similar function be implemented for addresses?\r\n\r\nIt could work something like this:\r\n\r\n- A company creates an address and their customers send regular payments to this account\r\n- Hacker gets access to the private key for this address, and withdraws coins\r\n- The company notices, and alerts customers not to use this address \r\n- The company signs a 'compromised' transaction using their private key\r\n- Any new transactions which spend to Address X are rejected\r\n\r\nExisting coins would still be able to be transferred out of the compromised address.",
