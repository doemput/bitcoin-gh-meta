The possible blinding interval is reduced to the getdata timeout (currently 2 minutes).\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is discussed in [Tampering with the Delivery of Blocks and Transactions in Bitcoin \\[1\\]](http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/578) and was described earlier in [Discovering BitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs Public Topology and Influential Nodes \\[2\\]](http://cs.umd.edu/projects/coinscope/coinscope.pdf).\r\n\r\nThis is a lighter implementation of #4547.  Attention is paid to the result of the insert into the existing collection setInventoryKnown, rather than introducing a new collection.\r\n\r\n#4547 was closed to focus on a wider solution that has been delayed.\r\n\r\n",
