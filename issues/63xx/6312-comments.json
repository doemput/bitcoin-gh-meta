Notably, see how without a way to fix tx mutability the nSequence proposal really isn't any different in practice than just signing increasingly decreasing nLockTime's? Because if you could safely sign the transaction it'd already be mined and thus you don't need a relative nSequence - an absolute nLockTime calculated from the height/time of the tx you know already is in the chain is fine.\r\n\r\nIMO there's no reason to merge this until it has a safe use-case that provides a concrete benefit over the existing status quo; a simple change in what exact number is being signed isn't a concrete benefit.",

      "body" : "Since posting the two alternatives 26 days ago, I have had conversations with many stakeholders via the mailing list, IRC, direct messaging, and in-person at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Montreal. Not all of these conversations were explicitly on the public record, so I will obey Chatham House rules in presenting a summary of these conversations in aggregate without identities attached. I hope that those who disagree with the summary or the outcome speak up in response.\r\n\r\n* There seems to be consensus in favor of BIP 68: I was unable to find anyone willing to argue that BIP 68 is on the whole a bad idea, so long as half of the sequence space keeps the original pre-BIP 68 (non consensus) semantics. The present pull request respects this constraint.\r\n\r\n* There is universal consensus that the bit-inversion step should be dropped. I have updated this pull request accordingly.\r\n\r\n* There is mixed views on whether the range of allowed relative lock-times should be constrained to set aside future bits for soft-fork changes (see: sequencenumbers2 and sequencenumbers3 discussed above). One developer argued strongly against this on the basis of favoring simplicity. Three developers argued to varying degrees in favor of setting bits aside for future soft-fork changes. The rest who were asked were explicitly indifferent. Nobody, of the developers who were asked, has said that they would retract their support for this pull request if the consensus were to be against them on this issue.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind I have decided to update this pull request to the sequencenumbers3 branch. This branch restricts maximum relative lock-times to approximately 1 year, and in doing so sets aside **5** bits for future expansion when using time-based relative lock-time (granularity: 1 second), and **14** bits for future expansion when using height-based relative lock-time (granularity: 1 block). Further bits could be set aside by decreasing granularity in a soft-fork compatible way.\r\n\r\nAll of the presently imagined use cases for BIP 68 and the related CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY opcode (#6564) use relative lock-times much less than one year, so it is expected that this constraint on the maximum range does not restrict usability in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nBIP 68 will be updated to reflect this new scheme.",

      "body" : "Just pushed a relatively minor consensus change to BIP 68 functionality, based on something that was observed while editing the BIP 68 and BIP 112 drafts.\r\n\r\nPreviously, it was possible to have a \"zero\" relative lock-time that allowed child and parent to be in the same block, but only if block-height was used. The smallest allowed relative lock-height using block-time required at least one block separation between child and parent. The reason for this asymmetry was a legacy of bit inversion where SEQUENCE_FINAL overlapped in meaning with 0-height relative lock-time.\r\n\r\nThere is no longer justification for treating these two units separately. Conceivably there could be an obscure use case where the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY parameter is calculated on the stack and yet the check itself needs to be disabled under some circumstances -- passing though a zero in this case could save a few bytes over wrapping the CSV in an IF/ELSE block. So I have opted for making the behavior symmetric in that both 0x00000000 (0 blocks) and 0x40000000 (0 seconds) allow child and parent to appear in the same block. The tests have been updated accordingly.",

More bits are reclaimable if you decrease granularity (in a soft-fork compatible way), e.g. round up the second based relative lock-time to the next multiple of 512, and you now have 14 bits for both units (512s is less than the expected time between blocks, so it's barely any a change anyway).",

      "body" : "Looks good. Having 1 year of relative time for nSequence is more than sufficient for multisigature revocation scripts used in systems such as Lightning Network. These systems have the particular use case of revoking multisignature double-spends via lower relative locktimes. In effect, the 1 year relative time becomes a dispute period for observing activity on-chain and is therefore well more than sufficient, as that presumes a maximum programmable length of onece per year when one watches the blockchain.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the per-input use of consuming a bit in nSequence makes a lot of sense, as there may be inputs with different behavior -- applying it to all inputs with nVersion would significantly increase complexity and reduce use, as maaku explained. It's also good to have similar functionality for blockheight and relative timestamp to match nLockTime.\r\n\r\nEnabling/disabling relative locks permanently consumes a single bit in nSequence seems to make a lot of sense, as there may be different uses of relative timestamps (e.g. timestops in the future) or more exotic uses. Stellar has something which uses the phrase \"sequence number\"[1] but appears that functionality in Bitcoin can be used without some sequence flag via sending to different Bitcoin addresses per transaction.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.stellar.org/blog/multisig-and-simple-contracts-stellar/",

BIP 113 changes the other end of the interval for both nLockTime and nSequence to be GetMedianTimePast, which is a soft-fork change, but changing the start of the interval in that way would be a hard-fork change. So we start from the very beginning using GetMedianTimePast.\r\n\r\nOk it is clear thanks !",

The problem is that we call LockTime (which was IsFinalTx before), but for BIP68 we need parent's height. If we need parent's height, then we'll query the view, which would kill your perf improvement #6898. Do you see a solution to the problem ?",

This is what we discussed in #6915, we only need to store one height, which is the max of the height the tx is viable for coinbase maturity and for BIP68 sequence numbers.  Then on a reorg we revaluate if the reorg dropped below this height.  \r\n\r\nSo that's necessary before #6312 can be merged? I or @sdaftuar can do it.\r\n\r\n",

In CNB if the blockid of the mempool entry is not in current chain, then we do the CNB test, else we can skip it. How does it sound ? Easy to implement, and not lots of room for mistake.

Adding finality of txs is next.\r\n\r\n@NicolasDorier What @sdaftuar and I are already working on is a variation of what you are proposing.  Our idea is to keep the mempool consistent so CNB never has to do any finality checks, so on a reorg you will recheck everything that may no longer be final.  You will do this by storing the height and time at which the entry is final, and only recalculating if the reorg dropped below that height (or for added efficiency if the reorg dropped below the height necessary to calculate those heights).  There is some nuance if we ever decide to allow non-final txs in the mempool (which seems like something we might want to do at some point).  In any case, I think we merge #6312 without that performance improvement and just bring the performance back in line before release.\r\n\r\n",

Returning 0 explicitly if we pass coinbase to LockTime() will disable the finality check if we pass by mistake a coinbase elsewhere to LockTime. Thoughts ?",

The first commit from my branch and maybe the change to CheckLockTime from the second.  The other changes should be in a separate PR that is backported only to 0.12 (but before the point release that contains this PR)\r\n\r\nI wanted to show the version that has the fewest changes from this PR first, but I do think its a good question as to whether thats the right goal.  This is unreleased consensus code still, so it might make sense to make a bit more substantial refactor.  Open questions:\r\n- After breaking up the function in two two parts, is it necessary to maintain the original `LockTime` interface?\r\n- Do we want to retain the semantics of returning an int64_t now that we're populating a bit more information in the LockPoints?\r\n- Should I return LockPoints instead of using an output argument?\r\n- Should maxInputHeight instead be a block hash or even BlockIndex*?\r\n- Obviously LockPoints shouldn't be in txmempool.h, but where should it go?\r\n- Reach goal: I'm not a super big fan of prevheights being NULL.  Do we still need the check in ContextualCheckBlock?\r\n\r\nThese changes would be very small additional changes to the consensus code, but would require changing all the tests, so it would be more to review.",

Not mentioning the fact we would need to update the BIP again. My change would achieve the same thing as you but with minimal changes. I will try to propose a commit.",

Let's say this was merged with morcos' preparations for his solution but without the actual solution for CNB. Let's say @NicolasDorier had had the odea only after merging morcos' preparations. Now what? Do we revert morcos' changes?\r\nThat's why I don't like including more things here. Regarding bakports, the same commits can be backported regarlesss of them being in a single PR or 2 separate ones.\r\nPlease let's leave this as it is and solve the CNB performance issue later, even if we all like Nicolas' solution. We may rhink of another even better solution later.",

I think this is wrong.  It had a lot of preliminary review, but then the code changed, and I think its had only minimal testing.   An example is the checking of sequence locks that is throughout the wallet and GUI code in this PR.  I believe those would lead to unacceptable performance for any node with a half way decent size wallet.  They would slow down a lot of operations and also make the utxo cache worthless.",

If the optimizations hadn't been urgent they could have been later during 0.13.99. But now it's too late for that, thus the need for #7176 . All the possible fixes could be built on top of the same branch (this one, for example) to compare them more easily, but seems not everybody agrees that a common base makes branches easier because I have already say this without the different proponents agreeing on a common base, and @maaku seems to be the only other person that thinks #7187 should be based on this PR instead of #7184 so I shouldn't insist on this.\r\n",
