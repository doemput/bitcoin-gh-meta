E.g. the 1200s timeout often disconnects peers currently providing blocks also. This does not imply that it takes >1200s to download a block, as obviously that would be too slow given the average 1MB of block data every 10 minutes, but what can often happen is that internet connections become temporarily slow (e.g. in shared places, such as hotels) and this can cause several blocks to be downloading concurrently, therefore many blocks taking > 1200s to download but still achieving an average download speed of more than 1MB per 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n#9213 and #9314 are related also",
