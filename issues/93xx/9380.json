   "body" : "I've been meaning to do this for a while.\r\nThere is no behavior change here, but there were unintended consequences of having these all of these different notions linked to minRelayTxFee.\r\n\r\n- blockmintxfee should be set by miners to reflect their marginal cost of transmitting extra bytes.\r\n- incrementalrelayfee was previously hard-coded to the default minRelayTxFee, but it should be configurable so it can be adjusted to reflect the cost of network wide relay of transactions.\r\n- dustrelayfee should not be accidentally changed when someone wants to limit their mempool to higher fee transactions.\r\n\r\nI plan a future change to make the wallet smarter about not generating change outputs near the dust limit at all.  I also think we should consider splitting dust into 2 dust limits if we ever raise it again and first raise the creation limit and second the standard limit a version later.  Since it is not clear we'll ever need to increase the dust limit, this change isn't introduced now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
