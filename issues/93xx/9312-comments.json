If we do end up in a situation where mining policy doesn't match our mempool policy, then at least we will eventually clear transactions that aren't getting mined.  Neither 3 days nor 2 weeks are sufficiently aggressive to resist an attack, but probably both still help in the case of accidental network misbehavior.\r\n\r\n2. It might make sense in the future to separately treat our own wallet transactions that are expired after 2 weeks.  They become good candidates for fee bumping or some other type of reuse.  It seems to me just abandoning them is probably unsafe advice, but perhaps we'd have a feature which respends the outputs back to ourselves if the original tx is no longer desired.  For now we will rebroadcast them, but hopefully this is rare.",

The reason the timeout exists is for robustness against unexpected events such as unknown new network rules, that result in apparently valid but high fee transaction not getting confirmed.",

It makes sense for us to ship it with a default that we think is best.  Anybody that disagrees is welcome to change the setting on their node, it will still interoperate perfectly well with the rest of the network.  As already mentioned: \r\n- There is no practical change for Core wallet users.  \r\n- For wallet users in general, it is my belief that they'd rather have placed transactions make it into a block after some delay rather than not at all, and in many cases there is also no practical difference for them either because of other people rebroadcasting transactions.  \r\n- Finally and most importantly, having the transactions stay consistently in the mempool will make it easier to properly track how long they are taking to be included in a block and provide more reliable fee estimates at lower fees.  This provides an important feedback effect if even only a few people take care of it because it allows fee estimation to detect when those lower feerates are being included in a block relatively quickly and can cause everyone to start paying lower fees.",

Moreover, due to full replacing miners, nodes restarting, and the transactions being evicted for having fees too low in practice I've found that replacements of non-RBF transactions work long before the expiration. So they'll work after this but can't be counted on even already due to the frequent third party rebroadcasts.\r\n ",

      "body" : "@jnewbery - Thanks for your reply. I guess I don't see what the benefit to anyone is for transactions that have no hope of being confirmed cluttering up the mempool (and the respective wallet) for two weeks. If they aren't going to get confirmed within a reasonable amount of time, they should go away. I wish I could use RBF or CPFP, but unfortunately, blockchain.info doesn't support it. As soon as the unconfirmed transactions go away, I will move to another wallet.",

There is typically less load on weekends, allowing a number of transactions from the week(s) before to still confirm. Also, the timeout generally has very little effect, as wallets can always rebroadcast to get another timeout period.",
