      "body" : "Currently there is only a single release signing key and you can only\nverify it indirectly, i.e. by trusting a person or a chain of persons\nwho trust Wladimir: Wladimir handles the release key and signed it\nwith his personal key. Wladimir's personal key is again signed by a\nnumber of people... If you happen to know some of those people, you\ncan verify their key and thus verify the release signing key. (Given\nthat they properly verify pgp keys)\n\nDetailed steps can be found in\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4y8m76/0130_binary_safety_warning_bitcoinorg/d6mao05/\n(requires basic knowledge about pgp)\n\nAlternatively you can verify a Bitcoin Core Release by recreating it\nfrom the source. Even tough each released tag is signed with Wladimirs\npersonal key, it is not required to verify the signature in this case.\nInstead, you follow the gitian guide for the released git tag (details\nin the /doc folder). And finally you verify your gitian result again\none or more other gitian results that are signed by persons you trust.\nFor example, you can find the signed results for 0.13.1 linux here:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs/tree/master/0.13.1-linux\n(Again, this requires you to set up pgp and go to a key signing party)\n\nFurther reading: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/wiki/verifying_bitcoin_core\n",
