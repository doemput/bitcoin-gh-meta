   "body" : "This is a pure refactoring, no behavior is changing.\r\n\r\nInstead of AddToWallet taking a temporary CWalletTx object and then potentially merging it with a pre-existing CWalletTx, have it take a callback so callers can update the pre-existing CWalletTx directly.\r\n\r\nThis makes AddToWallet simpler because now it is only has to be concerned with saving CWalletTx objects and not merging them.\r\n\r\nThis makes AddToWallet calls clearer because they can now make direct updates to CWalletTx entries without having to make temporary objects and then worry about how they will be merged.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change came from the bumpfee PR #8456 where we wanted to be able to call AddToWallet to make a simple update to an existing transaction, but were reluctant to, because the existing CWalletTx merging logic did not apply and seemed dangerous try to update as part of that PR. After this refactoring, the bumpfee PR could call AddToWallet safely instead of implementing a duplicate AddToWallet function.",
