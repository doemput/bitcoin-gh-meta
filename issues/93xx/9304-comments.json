For example, python-bitcoinlib's *getblock* call requires a little endian hash; the library converts the endianness internally before making the actual RPC call. Being able to write a hash list with linearize-hashes.py that's compatible with such libraries is, IMO, a nice feature to have. I know one could just convert the hashes separate from linearize-hashes. That would slow down other programs/scripts, though, even if only just a little bit.",

If I take the linearization-hashes output as-is, convert it into bytes, and try to feed it into a getblock() call, python-bitcoinlib chokes. If I reverse the bytes, as seen in this PR, python-bitcoinlib is happy. Even if this is a bug in python-bitcoinlib, I still like the idea of giving users the option of reversing the bytes for their own purposes.",
