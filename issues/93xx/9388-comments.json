Let me put it another way:  What possibly useful thing is anyone going to do with that data _except_ parse it out and chart it to observe the behavior?\r\n\r\nIf it's your belief that people are actually not using it, then it should be removed, not pretty printed to a variable unit that is a real pain to create summary information from.\r\n\r\nAny consistent unit is fine-- e.g. decimal minutes or whatever. it's fine to scale things to the most appropriate size for manual comparision. But varying the unit makes it much harder to programatically handle and sometimes even harder to manually compare... for little to no gain.\r\n\r\n@laanwj operators troubleshoot using machines to read the logs too.",
