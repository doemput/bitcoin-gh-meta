Also, removing the variable doesn't simplify the code very much. Another reason to keep it might be that having it could make it easier to remove the `fTimeReceivedIsTxTime` variable which I think is actually a stranger thing to serialize. It has similar meaning to `fFromMe`, but unlike fFromMe is not merged properly in `AddToWallet`.",
