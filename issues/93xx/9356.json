   "body" : "Hello, \r\n\r\nThis issue is about the windows guide for WSL:  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md\r\n\r\nI have tried several times by following this guide but it fails to build any version.  Even with a fresh clean install of WSL this guide doesn't work.  After *make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32 -j4*,  it says *checking whether we are cross compiling... no*.   Then if I went on with the configure line I would get this result: \r\n>checking for Berkeley DB C++ headers... no\r\n>configure: error: libdb_cxx headers missing, Bitcoin Core requires this library for wallet functionality (--disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)\r\n\r\nMichagogo gave us on IRC his short guide:   https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/W0iBQZbU/  which does work in building master and 0.13.1  versions but I can't get it to build v0.13.0.  \r\n\r\nAny help for this issue is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
