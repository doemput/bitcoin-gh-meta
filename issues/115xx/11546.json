   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\n\r\nTrying to sign a transaction offline using `signrawtransaction` will trigger an error : \"Input not found or already spent\" (very likely https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp#L860).\r\n\r\nThe point is to have an offline computer used as cold storage wallet and be able to sign some imported raw transactions created on another online computer (using watch-only addresses).\r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n1. Create an offline wallet (on an offline computer)\r\n2. Export offline wallet public keys (addresses)\r\n3. Import offline wallet public keys on an online wallet (other computer) (=> Watch-Only addresses)\r\n4. Fund an address\r\n5. use `createarawtransaction` from online wallet\r\n6. try to sign created transaction on offline computer having offline wallet : error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nSign the transaction, don't try to check if transaction is funded when offline.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nWon't sign the transaction because don't have access to blockchain offline.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.15.0.1\r\n",
