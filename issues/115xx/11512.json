   "body" : "4440710 broke inserting entries into addrman from dnsseeds which\r\ndid not support service bits, as well as static seeds. Static seeds\r\nwere already being filtered by UA for 0.13.1+ (ie NODE_WITNESS), so\r\nsimply changing the default service bits to include NODE_WITNESS\r\n(and updating docs appropriately) is sufficient. For DNS Seeds, not\r\nsupporting NODE_WITNESS is no longer useful, so instead use\r\nnon-filtering seeds as oneshot hosts irrespective of named proxy.\r\n\r\nI've set my testnet-seed to also support x9, though because it is simply a static host, it may be useful to leave the support off so that it is used as a oneshot to get addresses from a live node instead. I'm fine with either.",
