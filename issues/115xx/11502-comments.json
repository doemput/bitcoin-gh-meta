In this case your node was online for significantly more time than the fee estimate horizon you requested, so returned what were actually accurate fee estimates based on the last few hours. Others who are reporting conservative estimates are reporting something higher because prevailing feerates for fast confirmation were higher a day or three before. It would be prohibitive to require nodes be online non-stop for two weeks before providing fee estimates of any horizon, so instead you may see results for the time you were online which are more analogous to economical estimates than the conservative results of your peers.\n\nOn October 15, 2017 8:28:40 PM EDT, Phuong Nguyen <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>I'm confused because it is returning way-off value.
