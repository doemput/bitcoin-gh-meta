   "body" : "This change only updates strings and adds RPC aliases, but should simplify the implementation of address labels in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7729, by getting renaming out of the way and letting that change focus on semantics.\r\n\r\nThe difference between accounts and labels is that labels apply only to addresses, while accounts apply to both addresses and transactions (transactions have \"from\" and \"to\" accounts). The code associating accounts with transactions is clumsy and unreliable so we would like get rid of it.",
