   "body" : "This PR allows Bitcoin Core to be relatively easily built with Visual Studio 2017. It's anticipated that it could be useful for devs familiar with Visual Studio and Microsoft's tooling. In particular the ability to use the VS debugger is a big benefit.\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n- There are some minor code changes required on Bitcoin Core in order for msvc to be able to successfully compile. I'll submit them in a separate PR,\r\n- The vcpkg for SECP256K1 has not yet been accepted by Microsoft. The files are available from this [PR](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/pull/2005) and should be copied into a vcpkg/ports/secp256k1 directory prior to vcpkg install steps.",
