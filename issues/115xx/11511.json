   "body" : "While reviewing the bitcoin code I noticed that there are a few exit(EXIT_FAILURE) at various places in the AppInit function.\r\n\r\nThis function returns to main() which will return/exit with EXIT_FAILURE so returning false instead of an explicit exit(EXIT_FAILURE) seems to be cleaner.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to make things a bit more consistent.\r\n\r\nThere is a subtle difference between exit() and return from main in that the exit() will not clean up any local vars but I don't think this makes a difference in this case. Using exit() might even lead to bugs in the future where the dtor of local objects are expected to be called.",
