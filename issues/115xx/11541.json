I'd rather just remove it.\r\n\r\nThe mm.o rule was added to support XCode 4.2's ancient version of automake. That's irrelevant now, so it makes sense to remove that too.\r\n\r\nAll darwin targets are PIE by default, so we don't technically need the flags, but I'd be more comfortable if we hooked up the OBJCXXFLAGS in case future ones are added.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe second commit addresses the last point, but could probably use a better commit message.\r\nThese warnings are removed from autogen output:\r\n```\r\nMakefile.am:12: warning: user variable 'GZIP_ENV' defined here ...\r\n/usr/local/Cellar/automake/1.15.1/share/automake-1.15/am/distdir.am: ... overrides Automake variable 'GZIP_ENV' defined here\r\nsrc/Makefile.am: installing 'build-aux/depcomp'\r\nsrc/Makefile.am:503: warning: user target '.mm.o' defined here ...\r\n/usr/local/Cellar/automake/1.15.1/share/automake-1.15/am/depend2.am: ... overrides Automake target '.mm.o' defined here\r\n```\r\n",
