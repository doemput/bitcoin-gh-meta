Further, this absolutely doesn't help with testing anything... It's pretty disingenuous to claim that anyone wants this to assist in testing anything since the future behavior can be enabled by using the latest version number.\n\nIt's not like the various bloom-related DoS issues aren't thoroughly discussed in public already anyway, but those can be fixed directly (ie with the mempool-call-limits Greg was suggesting, maybe in conjunction with a similar limit on block requests).\n\nOn November 24, 2015 12:14:42 AM PST, MarcoFalke <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>It seems this conflicts with #6641\n>\n>---\n>Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n>https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7087#issuecomment-159191468\n",

We will likely always have some non-upgraded SPV clients regardless and this would be useful for testing how best to disconnect them.",

I've done experiments where I had bitcoind in a restart loop every few minutes, then compared which nodes were reconnecting, I'm fairly sure I've seen that behavior only with spy nodes.\r\n",

Breadwallet will choose a new random node for each reconnect attempt, and after 20 failed attempts in a row it will stop and display \"not connected\" in the UI, and wait for the user to manually initiate another 20 reconnect attempts to random nodes. It also keeps track of nodes that don't provide expected responses and marks them as misbehaving (not for network connect issues though). I'm also happy to take suggestions for improvements.",
