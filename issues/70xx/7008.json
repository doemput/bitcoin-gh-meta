   "body" : "I think this is a good compromise with regards to priority for 0.12 release. It is a calculation of priority in which only inputs that are in the chain at the time the transaction enters the mempool are aged.\r\n\r\nIt is a minimal amount of code and changes the `CTxMemPoolEntry::GetPriority` function to return a lower bound of the correctly computed priority as opposed to an upper bound.  This would allow the fast mining code in #6898 to use a priority calculation that at least ages the originally in chain inputs as opposed to using only starting priority.   \r\nI believe this better strikes the right balance between preserving the ability to meet previous policy objectives and adding too much complication to the code for a concept that is deprecated.  I plan to close #6357 in favor of this.\r\n\r\nOne caveat: In the event of a reorg, if one of the originally in-chain inputs is now no longer in chain (or has been moved to a different height) the calculation will no longer be a strict lower bound on priority because it will not take this into account.  \r\n\r\nIt should be kept in mind though, that this is a clear improvement on the current calculation.\r\n\r\n(Built on top of #7007 so the tests pass)\r\n\r\n\r\n(EDIT: For anyone that has already reviewed #6357, this is almost a strict subset)",
