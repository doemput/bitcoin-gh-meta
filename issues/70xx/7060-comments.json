I don't know if adding it is necessary for the non-OS X builds, and I haven't tried any of the network changes. In response to @TheBlueMatt, I don't think it's actually needed. I don't actually know if my container can access the Internet, but afaik it only needs it to download the depends files, and we have a step in release-process.md that downloads the files and seeds them into the gitian cache.",
