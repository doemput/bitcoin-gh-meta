It sets `$(package)_type` to `x86_64_linux` in the case of your example, the same as if you left out the unknown from the HOST. So you want to look for what depends is setting `x86_64_linux_CC` to.\r\n\r\nSee [depends/hosts/linux.mk](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/hosts/linux.mk). Assuming `86` is found in `$(build_arch)`, then `x86_64_linux_CC` is just set to `gcc -m64`. It is only if you are building on a system without `86` somewhere in the arch (like arm) that the prefix is added to `gcc`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the solution is, but as depends works currently, it would seem like you would need to do the prefix removal to use that toolchain without modifying depends.",
