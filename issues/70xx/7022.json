   "body" : "[As discussed on the mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-November/011713.html), the current notion of priority is no longer completely supported with the 0.12 release.   (In particular limited mempools will not allow free transactions when they have recently hit their limit).  It is likely that further support will be removed in future release and the current concept is now deprecated.  As such it makes sense to make the mining default not include priority space.  It is still supported to create a priority space if the command line argument is changed.  (To what degree depends on other open PR's)",
