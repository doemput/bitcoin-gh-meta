      "body" : "I apparently need to learn a lot more about how the wallet works!\n\nGlad you kind of agree on the Ã¢ÂÂreceived per address\" column. But since you donÃ¢ÂÂt seem 100% convincedÃ¢ÂÂ¦\n\nLetÃ¢ÂÂs say IÃ¢ÂÂve created 10 tipping addresses for 10 pieces of content IÃ¢ÂÂve created. And each entry in the Core client is labeled, so itÃ¢ÂÂs clear at a glance which content each address is associated with. If I could see the total sent to each address in a newly-created column, that would make the software much more useful. Maybe the additional info would be useful to others too.\n\nThanks for considering it!\n\n\n\n> On Nov 13, 2015, at 4:35 PM, Pieter Wuille <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Bitcoin Core wallet does not treat addresses as holding individual balances\n> - that's just an interpretation, and it doesn't work well with the use of\n> random fresh change addresses.
