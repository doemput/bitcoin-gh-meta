Otherwise I'll just have to refer to this PR (which I'll do in any case), but it's fine because there's things that will need to be backported anyway (ie csv and segwit) to the main implementation branch which will be based on top of last-0.12.99 3cd836c1 instead of master for easier consensus backports.\r\nSorry for the unrelated divagation...ping.\r\n",
