      "body" : "It seems like the SSLeay_version API is no longer available in 1.1. But since 1.1 is not yet released, I'm not sure if it's worth doing anything here right now. Even since the switch to libsecp256k1 ECDSA verification, I could imaging dropping the debug-log-info about the openssl version because its relevance is now significantly reduced (still used for wallet encryption, RPNG, bip70 but no longer consensus critical IMO).",
