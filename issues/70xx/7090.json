Natural followup to @laanwj's #6639, which creates hidden services automatically.\r\n\r\nCurrently the way addrman works hidden service peers won't be chosen very often, as there just aren't all that many of them on the network right now. It might be worth addressing that in a future pull-req to deliberately set aside connection slots groups for different types of peers, rather than having all outgoing connections be picked in the same way.",
