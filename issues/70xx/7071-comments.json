      "body" : "I agree in principle, but assertions on shutdown are extremely annoying. People google the error that pops up.\r\n\r\nThey tend to mask the actual error that caused the (sudden) shutdown. E.g it will end up in this assertion if the node was aborted suddenly for some other reason, and it didn't manage to close the transaction. The original exception will be lost (I think).\r\n\r\nWe had a similar assert in `~LockedPageManager()` for a long time - checking that the set of locked pages was empty on shutdown - and most bug report mentioned it in favor of more useful information from debug.log.\r\n\r\nAs long as all the usages are in function scope this isn't a problem. CDB is not a global object, unlike the CDBEnv. But make sure that this doesn't become a problem.\r\n",
