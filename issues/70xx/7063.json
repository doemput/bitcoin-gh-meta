   "body" : "@morcos mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6898#issuecomment-157847565 that there's no rpc test for `prioritisetransaction`.  This adds a simple test to exercise this logic.\r\n\r\nIn writing this test I discovered something unusual -- if you try to set a fee delta using `prioritisetransaction` that is negative and greater in magnitude than the transaction's fee, you get incorrect results.  The `CFeeRate` constructor that takes a fee and size doesn't work if you pass in a negative fee.  I don't really understand the details of how conversion and type promotion work in this kind of situation, but as far as I can tell, on my machine, I think the compiler promotes the `int64_t nFeePaid` to a `uint64_t` (`nSize` is a `size_t`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nnSatoshisPerK = nFeePaid*1000/nSize;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLink to the code: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c983d6fcb47bafb4b82529f512310ccaef076ca2/src/amount.cpp#L15\r\n\r\nI think this arithmetic may work on a 32-bit platform, because it looked to me like doing arithmetic with an `unsigned int` rather than a `size_t` appeared to work.\r\n\r\nAnyway I expect that #6898 will fix `prioritisetransaction` to work properly with fee deltas that bring the modified fee below 0, so I just avoided that issue for now in this test; I can update it in the future to include that case after #6898.",
