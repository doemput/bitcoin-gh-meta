Perhaps just one of the test combinations could run them all?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that a pull request check only finishes when all combinations are finished. CI is not very useful if you have to wait hours for a travis result to come in every time, so it relies on fast tests.\r\n\r\n> The idea of the extended list is to have an option to run expansive tests locally (and it also serves as a overview of all available tests).\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to run the extended tests, say, daily on master. No idea if Travis can be configured like that.\r\n\r\n",
