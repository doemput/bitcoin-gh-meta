   "body" : "I have a brand new setup with 0.9.3rc2 that has not finished syncing (~220k blocks so far) but which seems to have broadcast it's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses ahead of when it really should have. As far as I can understand from discussion on the forums the client is supposed to only do a self-announcement when it has completed at least the majority of the initial sync, but I started getting upwards of 50 incoming peers around height 100k. I've been able to reproduce this on a different server in a different rack. As of now I'm nearly maxed out with my peers and not even half way through the initial synchronization. \r\n\r\nThe IP addresses in question have never had a node running on it before, so it's not as if these are peers with a stale cache trying to connect to a node they have heard about before.
