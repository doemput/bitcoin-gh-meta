E.g. If you already have a change output, a pass that looks at the scriptpubkeys you're spending and keeps adding more inputs assigned to the same pubkeys until the fee increase is some threshold or the change exceeds 2x the payment value (or something like that) would probably result in lower total transaction fees over time.

      "body" : "Hi,\r\nFinished with my exams for this semester, finally had time to pick this up again.\r\n\r\n(When I created the .csv files with my output, I realized that my random models would sometimes generate spending instructions that asked for more than the wallet's current value. While those were were ignored as impossible, they still got into the statistics, so I wanted to fix that first.)\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about what one might want to be optimizing for. This is what I got so far:\r\n1. **Non-dust change**: The creation of small change outputs should be avoided. They bloat the blockchain and are expensive to spend.\r\n-> If a change output has to be created, it would be preferable to create a change output of the magnitude of the payment value. (Which would also help obscure recipient output and change output.) \r\n2. **Privacy**: UTXO should be picked non-deterministically, and as few different pubkeys as possible should be involved.\r\n-> Whenever the CoinSelection selects a UTXO, any UTXO assigned to the same pubkey should be preferred in selection.\r\n-> Small inputs that are significantly smaller than the size of the change and don't share their pubkey with a larger input should be pruned, as they increase transaction fee and decrease privacy.\r\n3. **Minimize transaction fee** A transaction input set should be preferred when it costs less to send.\r\n-> If spending some input costs more than what it contributes to the outputs it should not be added. Also, inputs that are extraneous should be pruned if that would lower the transaction fee.\r\n\r\n4. **Consolidate small UTXO?**\r\nOnce created, very small UTXO are in the blockchain anyway. \r\nIs it preferable to spend very small UTXO, in order to remove them from the UTXO-pool, or to ignore them until they become valuable enough to spend in their own right?\r\n\r\nHere are the statistics from my latest experiment.\r\n![ex19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4060799/4693226/ade9123e-578f-11e4-8765-653d41acc720.png)",

This removes the performance impact per checked subset, and still makes sure redundant outputs are removed from the final result.\r\n\r\nI've managed to reproduce this as well. For e.g. these input values:\r\n```\r\nvValues = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 100, 1000]\r\nnTargetValue = 251\r\n```\r\nApproximateBestSubset sometimes selects `[10, 10, 1000]`. Postprocessing like this can drop the redundant `10` inputs.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK - this cannot make things worse. Would be nice to have a unit test.\r\n",
