   "body" : "Summary: Clicking on splash screen causes it to disappear, leaving user with no status of the rescan.\r\n\r\nWhen bitcoin-qt is loading, the splash screen which displays the loading status disappears when clicked on, and then the status is hidden from the user. This will happen if a user goes to another application and then tries to click back to see the status. An example of this is when changing wallet.dat files, a rescan needs to be done which takes about 5-10 minutes. A % complete indicator is shown on the loading screen. After it is gone, the application shows no visual indicator to the user on what it is doing. The user just waits and hopes it loads eventually. Most users probably dont even know that clicking on it was what made it disappear, and assume it went to the background somewhere, but never find it. This is on Ubuntu. ",
