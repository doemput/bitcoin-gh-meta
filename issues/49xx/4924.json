   "body" : "I've installed the latest version of Bitcoin core 0.9.2.1 for Windows (64bit), than I've downloaded bootstrap.dat from the torrent file and put it into C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin and than I ran the bitcoin-qt.exe file. It started importing blocks from the bootstrap.dat file and after that it started syncing but after a little it got stuck while I ran out space on my C: drive and I got message \"Low on space!\" so I closed the wallet, transfered the whole Bitcoin folder to another partition (with 100GB of free space) and ran the wallet again but it was not syncing and I got stuck at block #285337.\r\nAfter that I reindexed the blockchain at @apoelstra's suggestion using the -reindex command but still after it finished reindexing it didn't want to sync and it got stuck again.\r\nThe solution was to delete everything, uninstall the Bitcoin Core, I ran CCleaner and fixed the registry (there was the exe file of the Bitcoin Core app on the list of the broken registry files), everything was cleaned up, then I reinstalled the wallet, put the bootstrap.dat again into the data folder(on the new partition) and it worked out ok in the end.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to put some kind of a limit on the drive where the blockchain is being installed so the blockchain download doesn't \"eat up\" the whole system capacity. So for example if the user has 1GB of free space left the wallet could detect that and pop out a message, for example \"Your drive has ran out of space, the sync has stopped. Please change the directory or empty some space on the drive\" so in that case the sync could start again normally after you free up the space on your drive or you change the directory of the files so the sync doesn't get broken.",
