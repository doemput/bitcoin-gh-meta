Create a Transaction hash cache to temporarily store the last used hash during the evaluation of a script.\r\n\r\n2. Verify that the ECDSA signature and the ECDSA public key are well-formed before hashing the transaction.\r\n\r\n3. Verify the length of pushed signatures of vin[i].scriptSig in CTransaction::AreInputsStandard() to see if they are long enough.\r\n (currently only stack.size() = (unsigned int)nArgsExpected) is tested, but not the actual arguments. )\r\n\r\nThe first 2 defense measures must be deployed together. \r\n",
