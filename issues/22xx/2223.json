We still don't\r\nrecommend anybody accept 0-confirmation transactions as final\r\npayment for anything. This change keeps non-final transactions\r\nfrom appearing in the wallet, and, assuming most of the network\r\naccepts this change, will eventually prevent them from being relayed until\r\nthey are final.",
