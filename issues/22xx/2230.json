   "body" : "Some changes/improvements to code that is new for 0.8 are still possible before doing RCs. These include:\r\n* Dropping support for the pre-checksum undo file format (#2216)\r\n* Changing the directory naming scheme. From a discussion on IRC it was apparent that for example the name coins/ was confusing (people thought it was related to the wallet). One suggestion:\r\n  * blocks/undo files remain in blocks/*\r\n  * blktree/ becomes blocks/index/* (so it is intuitively clear it's associated with the blocks directory)\r\n  * coins/ becomes chaindata/\r\n  * optionally: put everything inside a subdirectory blockchain/, and perhaps make it configurable with -blockchaindir=, as it is now independent from the wallet anyway.\r\n* Adding an automatically generated README in the data directory/directories to explain what the different files/directories contain (suggested by andytoshi on IRC).\r\n* Calling an ftruncate() (or windows equivalent) on the block files when abandoning them would remove the permanent storage waste caused by pre-allocated padding being left over.",
