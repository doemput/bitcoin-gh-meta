   "body" : "This pull is currently here to see how pull-tester is handling it. To really be sure I didn't break something, this pull should be sent through a Gitian build.\r\n\r\nI tried to harmonize the layout / style in all changed files. The QApplication moved to top in bitcoin.cpp and bitcoingui.cpp is related to Qt5 compatibility, I need to see if this is working correctly before I start doing my Qt5 compatibility pull.\r\n\r\n@laanwj I know this has the potential to make you angry (:-P)or at least may steal some of your time, but in the end it should be well worth it. I even think removed includes could speed up compilation time a little :).\r\n\r\n- try to enforce the same style to all Qt related files\r\n- remove unneeded includes from the files\r\n- add missing Q_OBJECT, QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE / QT_END_NAMESPACE\r\n- prepares for a pull-req to include Qt5 compatibility",
