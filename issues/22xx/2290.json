It is used to generate certain symbol names\r\n     that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used\r\n     to place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files\r\n     that produce them. You can use the -frandom-seed option to produce\r\n     reproducibly identical object files.\r\n\r\n     The string should be different for every file you compile.\r\n\r\nFor gitian builds, we are breaking the \"should be different for every file you compile\" rule, which doesn't seem to be causing an issues right now but which I could imagine causing impossible-to-debug problems in the future.\r\n\r\nA little googling turned up this discussion thread about what to do about it:\r\nhttp://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-toolchain/2010-November/000023.html",
