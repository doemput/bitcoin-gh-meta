   "body" : "Hi there,\r\n\r\nYesterday night I have encrypted my wallet using bitcoin tool. today when I open bitcoin tool It shows \"loading block index\" and than throws an error \"Wallet.dat corrupted\". Now I cannot access my wallet. I'm using Win7 64bit.\r\n\r\nI have created new wallet.dat by renaming old wallet.dat to wallet-old.dat. with new wallet the bitcoin tool opens fine, even I can encrypt the new wallet works fine aswell. I just don't know what happened to my original wallet.dat. I'm new to bitcoin topic and I don't understand why the bitcoin folder is 1.3 GB.\r\n\r\nIs there any way I can recover my address back? because I have locked that adress in a mining website (deepbit). it would be very thankful if anyone gives clue how to recover the wallet.dat in windows environment. All I see on google is either linux solutions which I have zero knowledge.\r\n\r\nPS: I dont mind sharing half of the money the wallet has if i get it back. ",
