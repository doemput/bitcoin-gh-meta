The old names are still\r\n> supported for compatibility\r\n\r\nbut that's only true on the command line, not for bitcoin.conf options.\r\n\r\nI have a bitcoin.conf with \"nolisten=1\" in it, but it's being ignored.\r\n\r\nThe \"interpret -nofoo as -foo=0 (and -nofoo=0 as -foo=1, as long as -foo not set)\" code is in util.cpp's ParseParameters() function and runs before the bitcoin.conf file is even read.\r\n\r\nThis breaks existing configuration files, so it's probably best to fix this before the release of 0.6.",
