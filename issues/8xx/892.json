Similarly if we have outputs of 50, 50, and 0.01 and want to spend 100BTC, we shouldn't include the 0.01 in the transaction.\r\n\r\nhttp://blockexplorer.com/tx/29a3efd3ef04f9153d47a990bd7b048a4b2d213daaa5fb8ed670fb85f13bdbcf shows a transaction where MtGox was trying to consolidate ten 50k outputs into a single 500k output.  The wallet had at least 11 50k outputs in it.  Because of this code in wallet.cpp:\r\n    if (nTotalLower >= nTargetValue + CENT)\r\n        nTargetValue += CENT;\r\nthe target value was increased from 500k to 500k plus a cent, which couldn't be found using just ten 50k outputs, and so an eleventh 50k output became involved, to avoid sub-cent change.  There was no need for any change at all.  (I notice the 50k change hasn't yet been redeemed.  I hope it isn't lost!)\r\n\r\nThese transactions show other common cases where extra 0.01 coins are tacked on to both sides of transactions for no good reason:\r\n\r\nhttp://blockexplorer.com/tx/a9d50d41be42beb278f5830d75aee06216b0a9c93d5eb5a62b6d30bec8c272f3\r\nhttp://blockexplorer.com/tx/a2f748139f90b5063aace9ab18cb0ceb011a440a5a51888e0ec6c7b71a12aed6\r\n",
