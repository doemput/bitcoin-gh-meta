In fact, fPreferHeaders couuld have been removed with this pull, but I've kept it in as it can be useful for debugging (i.e. showing the difference between headers being sent to nodes capable, and nodes which prefer them).\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke I will be running make check shortly as this is a good idea for sure.
