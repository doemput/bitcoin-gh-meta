Datadir now depends on -chain except for the reserved values.\r\n\r\nOther features:\r\n- [x] Uses a custom chain for all python tests.\r\n- [X] Create new testchains with different genesis hashes at will.\r\n- [X] Load chainparams from ~~separated~~ file or command line. (left for later, see https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/tree/b16-new-testnet-file )\r\n- [X] New chains are neither orange, blue nor green: they're purple and have your custom chain petname shown in the GUI.\r\n- Context: some people asked for signed blocks but that's way more disruptive and this is already review-thirsty (see #9177 ).\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\n- [x] Use a proper factory for creating chainparams #8855\r\n- [x] Introduce an ArgsManager class encapsulating cs_args, mapArgs and mapMultiArgs #9494\r\n~~- [ ] Really don't validate genesis block #9102~~\r\n",
