Even absent seeding, eventually it should learn something via the four that are up or via feelers.\r\n\r\nThe alternative I considered to the connect-to-relevant commit was adding something to periodically disconnect one of the peers without relevant services if all outbound slots were full. I decided this would be a more invasive change. A third alternative would be to allow a feeler with relevant services to replace a peer without relevant services; this would still probably be a more invasive change (but maybe only 3 LOC, e.g. if this is a feeler, and relevant, scan outbound peers, and if you find a non-relevant one, set disconnect on it instead).\r\n\r\nI did not consider any alternatives to the DNSseed commit.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not do anything here which would complicate a 0.13 backport.",
