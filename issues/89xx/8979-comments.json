      "body" : "That's not the feerate, that's the fee.   The feerate is about 27 sat/byte which is a bit low, but not ridiculously slow.\r\n\r\nDoesn't the GUI start with a default target of 25 blocks?  That could have been not far off the right feerate for a target of 25.  However, my node now says 56 sat/byte though for a target of 25, so what is more likely the case is one of two things:\r\n1) The node was new and didn't have enough data to do any fee estimation so it used the default of 20 sat/byte.\r\n2) The node had old fee estimation stats from last time it was run and fees were lower, and 30 mins isn't nearly enough to have the new stats outweigh old data (takes on the order of a couple of days).\r\n\r\nI have done other work on fee estimation to address both of those problems but I abandoned it quite some time ago as fee estimation seemed not a very popular topic.  I can revisit it at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
