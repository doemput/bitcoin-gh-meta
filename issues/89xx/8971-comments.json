      "body" : "Seems this might not be a problem, but perhaps highlights that some additional debug would help to see why no getdata blocks were sent.\r\n\r\nWith hindsight we can now see that block 00000000008de23f76f653be1dff8dd6ebc4bf5d6e5b915cc837734af498afb4 (998939) is the next block to follow, and this is not seen on the network until:-\r\n\r\n> 2016-10-19 09:08:26.633713 recv header 00000000008de23f76f653be1dff8dd6ebc4bf5d6e5b915cc837734af498afb4 (998939)\r\n\r\nwhich is then requested and becomes the new best:-\r\n\r\n> 2016-10-19 09:08:32.180607 UpdateTip: new best=00000000008de23f76f653be1dff8dd6ebc4bf5d6e5b915cc837734af498afb4 (998939) ver=0x20000000 date=2016-10-19 09:08:37 tx=487 100.000000%\r\n\r\nWhat was confusing is that other headers received after the new best 998938 with block height 998939 (but not the \"official\" 998939) are still shown in the debug but not distinguished as a different branch, e.g.:-\r\n\r\n> 2016-10-19 06:02:24.018650 recv header 00000000001f7b5d22d081021658e78fb2cde7ff86ccae65d62f66ab916d38cb (998939) \r\n> 2016-10-19 06:17:43.387935 recv header 00000000005c7500961a079c049c0bfb254585a7dd360364bf46ab3f0ef4e7a5 (998939)\r\n\r\nwhich upon first glance make it appear that block fetching is broken. Will work on a PR that will add a debug message to distinguish between main chain and alt chains.  Changing subject of this issue to signify that this is simply a debug ambiguity.",
