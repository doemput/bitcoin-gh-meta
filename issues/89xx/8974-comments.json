I'd recommend focusing on user-facing things, not developer-facing things such as code comments (unless they're terribly wrong; a typo in a comment is meh). But anything user-facing is bound to have much more impact.\r\n\r\nFor example, RPC help messages. The RPC help messages are part of the code, but in principle are just hard-coded text in the cpp files in `src/rpc/*.cpp` and `src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp`, e.g.:\r\n-  a simple one, `getblockcount` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp#L153\r\n-  a more extended one,`getblockheader` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp#L634\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are plenty of mistakes, both in language, and correctness of types/descriptions there, as well as things that could use clarification. And it would be very useful to improve them as they are a frequently used resource. \r\n\r\nOther documents that are essential are e.g.:\r\n\r\n- [Using bitcoin with Tor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md)\r\n- [UNIX build guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md)\r\n- [Gitian deterministic building](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nIn the GUI code (src/qt) are also plenty of user-facing dialogs and strings.\r\n",
