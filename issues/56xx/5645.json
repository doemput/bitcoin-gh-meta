Other people have similar problems:\r\n\r\n#4125\r\n#2726\r\n#4064\r\n\r\nAnd I think there are many more out there, who simply stop trying after DAYS of waiting and reindexing.\r\n\r\nI also think that the argument \"if this was a common problem we would have heard about it from more people\" is wrong:\r\n\r\nThe number of full nodes is small and shrinking. So there are not that many nodes using a certain version of the software trying to get the whole blockchain working from 0. In my example the Block is from Sept 22, 2014, which implies that all nodes that updated to 0.9.3 (released Sept 27) did not even have to deal with this block. Furthermore, there are many possible combinations of different systems and configuration options, that might affect this kind of problem. We need to accept, that these bugs would be hard to spot! And as a consequence, we have to take people reporting these kinds of problems more seriously!\r\n\r\nI bet, that if every node out there were to reindex its blockchain with 0.9.3 there would be a major fork!",
