For details: see my comment in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/1d46fe3327f6645fd79b442cd72ef422418c1a50.\r\n\r\nIf you send a raw transaction which has already been broadcasted, then you don't know whether you'll receive an RPC_TRANSACTION_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN exception, since you don't know whether a new block has just been received, which includes the transaction. There are use cases where such RPC_TRANSACTION_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN occurrences do not indicate an error; however, since this type of occurrence is very rare, developers are not likely to be aware of the possibility, and silence the exception. As a result, applications can potentially experience hard-to-diagnose, very rare errors.\r\n\r\nI think the core of the problem is that sendrawtransaction tries to combine two use cases:\r\nA: publish a transaction on the Bitcoin network\r\nB: re-transmit an already known transaction to peers\r\nRPC_TRANSACTION_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN might make sense for B, but for A (which is, IMHO, the primary use case) it is confusing.\r\n",
