   "body" : "I had some misunderstandings about what @luke-jr and I agreed and disagreed on #5071.\r\nThat's why I created #5180. The only disagreement is how you allow users to select ```Params().RequireStandard()``` independently of the chainparams selected (but we agree that should be possible,  @petertodd does too https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5521#issuecomment-67774957). That little disagreement is out of scope for this PR. The two potential solutions should be easier to review, maintain and discuss after this PR has been acked.\r\nI thought he also disagreed on:\r\n\r\n1) Only the interface can be accessed from outside policy.cpp, the implementation is hidden.\r\n2) policy.o shouldn't depend on main.h or contain any concurrency-related code.  \r\n\r\nHe doesn't disagree, he was just doing some things faster and left others for later in his version of policy encapsulation (https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/tree/nodepolicy2). There's a version rebased on top of this PR that satisfies 1 but not 2 in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/tree/luke_policy2 [I'm afraid I've also introduced an error in the last 3 commits].\r\nHe thought I also disagreed on:\r\n\r\n3) static variables contained in policy.o should become parameters of the reference policy implementation (CStandardPolicy).\r\n\r\nI don't: I was just leaving that for later.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mostly composed of code movements that I expect will be uncontroversial. 3 commits just move a single function and its associated globals if any. 2 of them are not purely moveonly because they change the function headers or move some functionality from one function to another, but are mostly code movements.\r\nFinally, the last commit creates a CPolicy interface (abstract class) and a CStandardPolicy implementation; and it's open for method name bikesheding.\r\n@luke-jr if you like this PR I'm closing #5595 and #5114.",
