      "body" : "I can't disagree with consistency. The question is, would it be better to add the other stuff to OS X, or remove it from Windows? The thing is that the two systems have very different install paradigms. OS X is \"drag (what looks like) this one file/blob into place\", while Windows is \"run this installer, it puts everything in the right place, updates it if needed, and registers with the system\". I would personally think that adding it to OS X (if that's possible, I don't know much about OS X's apps-that-are-really-directories-but-pretend-to-be-files-in-Finder-and-magically-start-the-right-executable structure) would be preferable to removing them from Windows, because for Windows users like myself, having the exe be in a specific place and auto-updated is nice, and I assume that it would be the same for OS X users, with the ability to have a single update action that updates everything in place, with all paths remaining as-is. So from that standpoint, I think I would vote for adding the extras to OS X rather than dropping them from Windows. But I don't know if this kind of change is too big to go in between RCs. If so, I would say that we should add bitcoin-tx.exe for now, sticking with the current practice of shipping all the bins (other than the tests) in the installer.",
