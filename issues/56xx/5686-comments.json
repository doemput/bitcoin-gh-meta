Move `wallet,walletdb,rpcwallet` (and others as needed) to `src/legacywallet`. \r\n\r\nThen build this new wallet with new database, new interface in `src/wallet/`. As well as a migration tool.\r\n\r\nUsing a configure option, one can then either build against the new wallet or the old wallet.\r\nThis gives the 'conservative' choice to stick with the old wallet (for however long we're willing to carry it) with all its quirks, but without intermediate complications for the new code, and having to carry any of that over.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the legacywallet will be the default and the new wallet will be experimental-only.\r\n\r\nThis is basically the \"fork the wallet and develop it separately\" approach, but a bit improvised as it's all in one repository - for now. It means we can merge this soon(TM) and experiment with it, instead of delaying that to a further future 'when it's ready'. \r\n\r\n(the only complication here I see is with regard to the UI, which has to interface with both, but a similar thing can be done there; UI that only applies to the old wallet can be moved to a legacy directory)",

Couldn't that not lead to a need of supporting both formats? And if we once drop support of BDB, how is the migration process different now from the one in future (the user has to do it once anyway)? Maybe we could force people to upgrade and save some - already rare - development resources. I mean it's not the network, it's the wallet.",

The old wallet will stay exactly as it is now (barring critical fixes). The new wallet will see new development, and come with new features (as well as get rid of old cruft), and an interface that supports e.g. multiwallet. It just means that the transition process is more smooth.\r\n\r\nMore daring users can use the new wallet, whereas more conservative  users can stay with the old wallet for say a major release or two until it is completely axed (but the new one, as well as the conversion process, much better tested).\r\n\r\n@luke-jr Building a monster executable with *both* wallet implementations could be possible, with e.g. an command line option to switch. Not sure if this is a good idea in practice, but I don't want to exclude the possibility upfront. We'll see when we get there I suppose. *In the beginning* this won't be an issue as the new wallet will be experimental-only so requiring build-time invocations is a good thing.\r\n",

Unless somebody else convince me for another way i think i start with this (maybe this is more or less the original idea of @laanwj):\r\n- Replace the wallet code inside of the `#ifdef WALLET_ENABLE` with flexible hooks. Goal: get rid of wallet-code inside of the bitcoind's general code. We can keep the ifdefs or we could provide a empty \"no-wallet\" instance to allow the user to run without a wallet.\r\n- Move everything wallet related to `src/wallet/` (rpc dispatch table, unit-test, etc.)\r\n- Create a clean, more or less abstract, wallet interface outside or `src/wallet` where wallets can inherit from \r\n- Add support for the legacy bdb wallet (update to the new interface)\r\n- Add support for the already more or less done logdb wallet\r\n- Add a feature flags to wallet-interface so bitcoin-qt can check if a wallet support a such feature like multiwallet, backup-capabilities, bip32, etc.\r\n \r\nThis would be more effort then i originally thought, but will finally cut out the wallet-code and place it behind a clean interface.\r\n\r\nAny concerns when going into this direction?",

As with the NotificationInterface, just give it a general name, like ModuleInterface. In this case it's used to plug in a wallet, but the same mechanism could be used to plug in another module that provides e.g. RPC calls and hooks into the init/shutdown.\r\n\r\nThis is not just a hack to support two wallets, but a step toward more modularity. Not sure if you ever saw #3440, but it was a plan in the same direction.\r\n\r\n> if we support both wallets, things like multiwallet or bip32 needs implementation in both worlds. Even if only one wallet type can handle things like multiwallet support, the interface needs adaption for supporting this somehow.\r\n\r\nMy point was to *avoid* a common interface by completely separating the implementations. E.g. move the old wallet and RPC code that uses it out of the way.\r\n\r\nIf this turns out to not be possible/practical, of course you could decide to not do this.\r\n\r\nI'm just afraid this will mean it will take a long time until the new wallet can be merged. It means it needs to be suitable for *all* users of the current wallet, instead of initially just experimental users. It also means it will get a lot less testing until it is merged. This has shown to be a problem for pulls that make large changes to the wallet before (like the last round of multi-wallet changes), eventually resulting in the owner giving up and them never being merged. That's why I proposed this, not to give you extra work.\r\n\r\n> But yes. The legacy-bdb-wallet needs a lot of moving/changes to fit in a new flexible wallet implementation.\r\n\r\nOK, my idea was that this would not be needed. Every change potentially introduces bugs. If you need many changes to the legacy wallet, this defeats the purpose of having a stable, unchanged legacy wallet.\r\n\r\n",
