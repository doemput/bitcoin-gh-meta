Also, my other Statoshi nodes have continued running without getting stuck. \r\n\r\nHere's my debug log from the period during which the block height became stuck: http://pastebin.com/9bk4ptfA\r\n\r\nThe node is still receiving block messages but doesn't seem to be processing them - I don't see any updateTip messages or block error messages in the log. I'm not sure what to make of this.",
