   "body" : "This is blocking #6051 and #5595\r\n\r\nThere's no way to start moving consensus and policy code effectively out of main without creating a first .h file.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nIt was initially a tiny first step to sepearate consensus and policy but afer a lot of discussion it ended up being a tiny step towards separating only more consensus.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this PR is stop blocking the 2 PRs mentioned in line 1.\r\n\r\nOUTDATED (for archive):\r\n\r\nWhile we discuss what the CPolicy interface should be #5595, we can start by just moving constants and globals to consensus.h and policy.o.\r\nThis will also open the door to some cleaning up on the includes.\r\nnMaxDatacarrierBytes and MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY are not moved from script/standard.o to policy.o because policy.o is in server while script/standard.o is in common and wouldn't link.\r\n\r\nPlease propose any other constant or global variable related to consensus or policy that I may have missed.\r\n\r\nNew but irrelevant:\r\nAre you still reading?\r\n\r\nThis PR is so simple that the following comments are equivalent:\r\n\r\n* utACK\r\n* ACK\r\n* ACK: I didn't read the code but I fully tested in all ways I could think of and it doesn't seem to break anything.\r\n* I didn't tested it but I did finally read the code.",
