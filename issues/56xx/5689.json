Also, it avoids the openssl include from allocators.h, which essentially forced openssl to be included from every compilation unit.\r\n\r\nAlso a few minor header cleanups.\r\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of putting a single function in this object, but we use it at such low levels (allocators.h) that i don't want to stick it somewhere that would pull in other headers. Suggestions welcome.",
