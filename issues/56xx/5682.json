Bitcoin Core popped up a Payment request window that was shaded Green and showed a Coinbase order code and  BTC amount.\r\n\r\nOn the Bitcoin Core window there was no obvious user interface to display the certification authority or certificate chain on which trust was based, thus I had no basis for trusting this request. I consider the combination of the green shading and lack of ability to validate the chain to be a security bug. \r\n\r\nAnother concern (might be a Wikimedia or Coinbase web bug) was that I could find no connection between the Coinbase order number displayed by Bitcoin Core and anything on the web page that contained the bitcoin: link that activated the Payment Request window.\r\n",
