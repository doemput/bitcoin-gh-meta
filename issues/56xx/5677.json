   "body" : "- *Replace usage of boost::asio with [libevent2](http://libevent.org/)*. boost::asio is not part of C++11, so unlike other boost there is no forwards-compatibility reason to stick with it. Together with #4738 (convert json_spirit to UniValue), this rids Bitcoin Core of the worst offenders with regard to compile-time slowness.\r\n- *Replace spit-and-duct-tape http server with evhttp*. Front-end http handling is handled by libevent, a work queue (with configurable depth and parallelism) is used to handle application requests.\r\n- *Wrap HTTP request in C++ class*; this makes the application code mostly HTTP-server-neutral\r\n- *Refactor RPC to move all http-specific code to a separate file*. Theoreticaly this can allow building without HTTP server but with another RPC backend, e.g. Qt's debug console (currently not implemented) or future RPC mechanisms people may want to use.\r\n- *HTTP dispatch mechanism*; services (e.g., RPC, REST) register which URL paths they want to handle.\r\n\r\nBy using a proven, high-performance asynchronous networking library (also used by Tor) and HTTP server, problems such as #5674, #5655, #344 should be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhat works? bitcoind, bitcoin-cli, bitcoin-qt. Unit tests and RPC/REST tests pass. The aim for now is everything but SSL support.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options:\r\n\r\n- `-rpcthreads`: repurposed as \"number of  work handler threads\". Still defaults to 4.\r\n- `-rpcworkqueue`: maximum depth of work queue. When this is reached, new requests will return a 500 Internal Error.\r\n- `-rpctimeout`: inactivity time, in seconds, after which to disconnect a client.\r\n- `-debug=http`: low-level http activity logging\r\n\r\n(due to the separation of RPC and HTTP server, renaming these options may make sense, but I've kept this out of backwards compatiblity)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] ~~Build system (currently hardcodes libraries, so this will definitely not pass Travis)~~ (thanks @theuni)\r\n- [x] ~~REST and RPC register their own request handlers respectively~~\r\n- [x] ~~Qt debug console must register a RPCTimerInterface (to make timeouts in the debug console work with -server=0)~~\r\n- [x] ~~Interrupt/Shutdown flow needs to be cleaned up~~\r\n- [x]  ~~`[warn] event_active: event has no event_base set.` appears sometimes to the console. Seems to be harmless, but it is weird (see @ajweiss comments)~~\r\n",
