Just tell me whether I shall submit such a change (on top of the real buglets).\r\n\r\n@practicalswift, I will provide smaller commits soon.  I think that I've also found the reason for the failure Ã¢ÂÂ I incorrectly assumed that the move of `QT_VERSION` from `qglobal.h` to `qconfig.h` happened with Qt 5.0 (it actually seems to have happened in Qt 5.4).",
