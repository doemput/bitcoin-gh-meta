Add a descrption about the evaluation order of `<include>` and\r\n  `<exclude>` to clarify how debug loggig categories to be set.\r\n3. Add a description about the available logging category `\"all\"`\r\n  which is not explained.\r\n4. Add `\"optional\"` to the help text of `<include>` and `<exclude>`.\r\n5. Add missing new lines before `\"Argument:\"`.\r\n6. `\"0\"`,`\"1\"` are allowed in both array of `<include>` and `<exclude>`.\r\n  `\"0\"` is **ignored** and `\"1\"` is treated **same as** `\"all\"`.\r\n  It is confusing, so forbid them.\r\n7. It always returns all logging categories with status.\r\n  Fix the help text to match this behavior.",
