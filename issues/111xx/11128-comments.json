Then we will reach full blocks again with only small part of population.\r\nThen 32 MB?  And then 1GB? 100GB?\r\nThere is not enough room to serve the whole world. You need to think different about viable solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't want other to control my own belongings. And that's why I use Bitcoin.With eternally blocksize increases, Bitcoin could in theory process transactions on big scale as Paypal and VISA, but it's will not be different anymore from another big payment systems, only big companies could be able afford to run the infrastructure for Bitcoin payment system. Not me and not everyone. \r\nDidn't you even wondered why Bitcoin is so extraordinary? \r\nThe decentralized nature of Bitcoin for everyone is the core value of Bitcoin. It's what makes different from other payment systems. \r\nLike me, Bitcoin is for the Joe the Average who want to control his own money.  \r\nNot the money system as big enterprises wished to be. You need to think in the long term about solutions to keep Bitcoin decentralized, that is what really counts in the long term. Not the 'dumb' solutions, or we will eventually end up with the basically same payment systems running by big companies.",
