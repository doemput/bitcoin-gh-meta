Out of scope perhaps, but it might be useful to have a wallet setting \"use SegWit\". This would cause new (change and receive) addresses to be SegWit by default.\r\n\r\nBIP 49 uses different private keys for SegWit vs. non-SegWit addresses. But BIP 44 is a prerequisite for that.

Is there a reason why Witnessifier class is not exposed in [wallet.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.15/src/wallet/wallet.h) which AddressTableModel allready depends on?",
