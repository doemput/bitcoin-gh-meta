Instead of prematurely setting 1025 bytes to zero my suggestion is to set only one byte to zero when needed :-)\r\n\r\nIn addition to being more efficient and less surprising, this has the added benefit of making some static analyzers happy - I've seen at least one static analyzer getting confused by the current \"indirect\" string termination logic via `memset` used here.",
