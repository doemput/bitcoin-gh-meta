   "body" : "I wrote an app that sends two transactions which double spend the same output in a row. The second never generates a reject message, because we end up in the dead \"replace tx\" codepath which returns false and doesn't even log anything, so the tx disappears silently. I think if that codepath is taken out or just #defined out so it's clear where the fixed code should go once done, then it will fall through to the other checks below.\r\n\r\nHowever then we have a second problem, which is that if all the tx outputs are spent already, it also won't trigger a reject message because it will hit the block starting with\r\n\r\n        // do all inputs exist?\r\n\r\nand end up failing to find the CCoins, so again, no reject message.",
