   "body" : "H Gavin. \r\n\r\nReally hope you get to read this and the subsequent email I sent:\r\n\r\nHi Gavin\r\n\r\nMy name is Andrew van der Nest from Cape Town South Africa. \r\nI run the Bitcoin Cape Town Meetup as well CEO of the soon to be established South African Bitcoin Foundation.\r\n\r\nAt our last meetup we raised the issue of lost coins through neglect or hardware issues (failed drive etc). We subsequently solved the issue in the following way:\r\n\r\nThe Bitcoin network needs to validate wallets every 6 - 12 months.\r\nWallets that are not verified would then be destroyed and those coins allocated back to the network to be mined again ensuring the 21 million are always in circulation. The challenge is there are of course a lot of wallets out there as well as many online (guessing the QT wallet would be a bit easier). However the blockchain does of course have all address in it and would be a source of information. If there way a way to download all wallet addresses the task may be a lot easier.\r\n\r\nKnow this is way easier said than done but I think this is something the team should consider working on as it is a real problem that requires a solution.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAndy\r\n",
