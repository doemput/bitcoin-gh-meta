Bitcoin Core is probably already running.\r\n```\r\n\r\ntest_runner.py and test_framework.py are very careful to not re-use ports for p2p and rpc interfaces on different nodes/tests, so perhaps another process was bound to 11211. Googling for port 11211 shows that it's memcached's default port.\r\n\r\nShould be easy to test whether port 11211 causes problems by pushing a branch with `port_seed()` changed.\r\n\r\n",
