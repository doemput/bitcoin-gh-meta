   "body" : "This carries the walletdb object from top-up through GenerateNewKey/DeriveNewChildKey/CWallet::AddKeyPubKey, which allows us to avoid the flush on destruction until the top up finishes instead of flushing the wallet for every key.\r\n\r\nThis speeds up adding keys by well over 10x on my laptop (actually something like 17x), I wouldn't be surprised if it were an even bigger speedup on spinning rust.\r\n\r\nThen it increases the keypool size to 1000. I would have preferred to use 10,000 but in the case where the user creates a new wallet and then turns on encryption it seems kind of dumb to have >400KB of marked-used born unencrypted keys just laying around.\r\n\r\n(Thanks to Matt for cluesticking me on how to bypass the crypter spaghetti)",
