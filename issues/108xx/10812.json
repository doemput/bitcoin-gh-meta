   "body" : "bitcoin-cli's `-rpcconnect` can accept ipv6 addresses (as long as the libevent version is new enough), but fails to parse ipv6 with square brackets. This PR makes `bitcoin-cli` parse ipv6 in square brackets correctly.\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli -rpcconnect=[::1] <command>`\r\n\r\nshould now be equivalent to\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli -rpcconnect=::1 <command>`\r\n\r\nThis is useful so the `bitcoin-cli` option can now be in the same format as the `bitcoind` option.\r\n\r\nDoesn't include tests. I have a branch that fully tests `bitcoin-cli`, but that's queued behind several intermediate PRs.\r\n\r\n- first commit moves `SplitHostPort()` from libbitcoin_common into libbitcoin_util\r\n- second commit adds proper ipv6 parsing to bitcoin-cli",
