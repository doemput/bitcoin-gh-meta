      "body" : "In what way is this a bug? Bitwise OR'ing an odd number (except for 1) means that you are setting multiple bits, not just one bit. That is not a problem as BLOCK_VALID_MASK is just a bit mask for all of the bits that must be set for a block to be valid. The same effect would be achieved by not including BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS in the bitwise OR since BLOCK_VALID_HEADER and BLOCK_VALID_TREE already set bits 1 and 2. But having BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS there is not wrong and makes it easier for people to understand what enums are part of BLOCK_VALID_MASK.",
