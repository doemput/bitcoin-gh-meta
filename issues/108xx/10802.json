   "body" : "Temporary fix for #10678 \r\n\r\nzapwallettxes.py doesn't test anything due to a syntax error.\r\n\r\nFixing the syntax error causes the test to fail because of bad interaction between zapwallettxes and persistent mempool. There is a fix for that in #10330 \r\n\r\nUntil #10330 is merged we should disable this test. There's no point in running a test that doesn't actually test anything, and which occasionally causes spurious Travis failures.",
