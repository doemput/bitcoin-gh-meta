The wallet does also something if you can't access it via bitcoin-cli, a) it syncs, b) you can access it with other tools (RPC, maybe later Qt).\r\n2. If you have decided to use a default wallet via `-usewallet` in your conf, and then want to access other wallets *with bitcoin-cli*, then just remove `-usewallet` from the conf (no need to restart the server). This seems to be the right level of encourage/discourage for the using a default wallet.",
