We didn't create a BIP for expiry, so why does this need a BIP?\r\n\r\nSecondly, writing a BIP for such a trivial change gives the misleading impression that you could rely on the opposite behavior. We've had continual problems with people misunderstanding the security properties of zeroconf; there's no reason to add to that problem.",
