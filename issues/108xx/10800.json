There are a few unknowns:\r\n- A boost LTO issue was addressed here, but others may remain for different libs/versions\r\n- ar/ranlib detection will likely turn out to be annoying\r\n- Not yet tested with Gitian\r\n\r\nI propose adding this as-is (maybe after Gitian testing), and seeking feedback. I suspect that there will be quite a few platforms/toolchains where it's broken, but there's only so much we can do about it.",
