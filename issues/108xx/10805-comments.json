I prefer the current state.\r\n\r\nWhy move the manpages to `src/`? `doc` seems a better place.\r\n\r\nAlso we *had* manually written man pages, but no one was updating them, so we went with the automatically generated approach. This was less than a version ago. See #8608.\r\n\r\nThe old debian manpages were removed here: b194872 - both due to license issues, and due to not being maintained.\r\n\r\nWe're not going to change this again now. Sorry.\r\n",
