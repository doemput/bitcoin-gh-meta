We want to add a wallet option right now. Great, so that can be as simple as adding `?wallet=filename` to the query string to provide the nice user benefit Greg cites. And maybe you have a problem with timeouts or completion handlers, but lets say we want to add a `?network=name` parameter in the future (maybe to add extra way to specify that an operation is done on mainnet or testnet, or in some dystopia where there are multiple chains, but no need to go there...). The point is you want to be able to add some new option. With query strings you have a standard way to do this. `?wallet=filename&network=name&timeout=30s` works just as well as `?timeout=30s&wallet=filename&network=name` as established by long-running convention.\r\n\r\nIf we use paths instead, are we requiring `/wallet/filename/network/name` or `/network/name/filename` or `/wallet/filename?network=name`, or something else completely arbitrary based on historical accident? Or because a filename is a \"location\" but a network name isn't?\r\n\r\nI guess another thing that is motivating me is that I would like to see less uri-path space annexed for this one multiwallet feature. Right now json-rpc calls go directly to `/` handler and REST calls go directly to `/rest` handler. Everything else right now (but not with these endpoint prs) is wide open right now. I'd be happier if more of the path space could be free for other applications like a web interface. If these prs added stuff under an `/rpc` path, that would also seem like an improvement to me.\r\n\r\nAlso, so my other points doesn't get lost above, it would be great to see something done on documentation and `-usewallet` if we are taking this endpoint approach. Even if there is not \"100% documentation\" I think it would be very helpful to see uri-path endpoints explained from user point of view.",

      "body" : "> It's under /wallet/ at least, so I think it won't have any clashes with other use.\r\n\r\nI could easily imagine a web interface wanting to handle /wallet path. The point is that if RPCs are restricted to exactly one path `/` (current case) or two paths `/` and `/rpc` then it's then it's clean and easy to do anything else with the rest of the space. If there's a bigger changing list of RPC paths, that would seem to make things messier.\r\n\r\n> As far as usewallet-- I think we intend that argument to eventually specify all wallets that get loaded, not just specific to rpc. e.g. it would also tell it which ones to load in the UI when that support is complete.\r\n\r\nThat's interesting. I thought the UI was would just have tabs or a dropdown to choose between any of the loaded wallets. But I guess the advantage of having the `bitcoin-qt` executable accept a `-usewallet=filename` instead of a more descriptive `-showwallet=filename` or `-onlyshowwallet=filename` would be that you can specify `-usewallet` in your `bitcoind.conf` and have it picked up by both `bitcoin-cli` and `bitcoin-qt`.",
