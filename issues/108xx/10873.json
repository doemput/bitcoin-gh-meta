   "body" : "Currently bitcoind polls every 200ms to see if a shutdown has been requested. This causes the process to wake up frequently and unnecessarily when the network is idle. The change here adds a condition variable so that the main bitcoind thread can do a blocking wait on the condition variable, rather than polling. Without this patch (i.e. in master) if you strace bitcoind you will see a lot of nanosleep() calls, with this patch the process does just a blocking wait on a futex(). The motivation here is that I want the CPU to be able to stay powered down more on my local bitcoin node.\r\n\r\nI elected to keep `fRequestShutdown` as an atomic variable, even though a new mutex is added for the condition variable, just to minimize code churn. I think there's a case to be made that it should be turned into a regular bool and then `ShutdownRequested()` should use the mutex, but I don't have a strong preference. To make it non-atomic and use the mutex would make the diff a little bigger, as there are a few places that read the atomic variable directly.\r\n\r\nThis is my first Bitcoin diff. I have read the contributions doc, but please let me know if I made any errors related to code style, contributing, etc.",
