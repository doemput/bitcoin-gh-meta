   "body" : "Adds an `updatepeer` RPC to update peer config and carry out actions on the peer by NodeId. At the moment, the actions are just changing whitelisting settings and disconnecting. Other possible actions are changing banscore, banning, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to be called using named arguments, but due to the RPC infrastructure can also be called with positional arguments (although doing so would be very fiddly).\r\n\r\nI've set the category to hidden for now. I have a feeling we may want to make the whitelisting behaviour more granular and I don't want to commit us to a public API that we can't then change.\r\n\r\nThis should only be merged after @theuni's changes here: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/57ea0cc55e0368466c32f3fd272e48504ab2871d are merged to make nodeId safe against wrapping.",
