   "body" : "Functional test results were previously printed in the order that the tests finished, which is fairly arbitrary. This commit prints test results in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nThe commit also colors the passing tests blue, failing tests red, and skipped tests grey, to make it easier to spot failing tests. I'm happy to debate the color of the paint.\r\n\r\nImplementation is by creating a new TestResult class, which opens the way to provide test results in different formats (html pages, email reports, etc).",
