   "body" : "**This is based on #10244**\r\n\r\nThis is an experimental change, and a very early (not yet usable) work in progress. It adds some IPC functions and classes in [src/ipc/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc) that let the `bitcoin-qt` process fork a `bitcoind` process and communicate with it over a socketpair.\r\n\r\nOnly a handful of IPC calls are implemented, but this demonstrates a working framework supporting bidirectional IPC calls (both requests from `bitcoin-qt` to `bitcoind`, and notifications from `bitcoind` to `bitcoin-qt`). The IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in `ipc/server.cpp` and `ipc/client.cpp`, and not in any headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\nThe main commit is https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102/commits/ab0afba3a44255b3eec80f4eebe45a851ae23927 \"[qt] Make bitcoin-qt control bitcoind over socket\"\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this change is to be able to start moving bitcoin from a monolithic architecture where UI, P2P, wallet, consensus, and database code all runs in a single process, to a more modular design. Splitting the bitcoin-qt code from the bitcoin node and wallet code seemed like a logical place to start because we already have separate bitcoin-qt and bitcoind binaries, and because the Qt code is already somewhat modularized thanks to various model classes.\r\n\r\n**Review suggestion:** It'd make sense to start by looking at the [src/ipc/README.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/README.md) file and then begin to look over the other new `src/ipc/` files in the order they're listed in the README.",
