Thanks for documenting it here.\r\n\r\nreject messages are somewhat useful in black box testing. We can send in invalid messages and assert that bitcoin rejected them _for the right reason_. The old style 'comparison' test cases use this a lot. That's not a justification for spending a heap of time on improving them, but I think there's no harm in small fixes like this. And if no-one's using them in live deployments, then it should be an uncontentious change, right? :)\r\n\r\nDefinitely agree with improving error-handling in general. I don't know exactly what that would look like, but it's beyond the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\nFor my own education, do you have references to the serious bugs that reject messages have caused?",

      "body" : "> For my own education, do you have references to the serious bugs that reject messages have caused?\r\n\r\nPR #4903  was mostly what I was thinking of there, also the original implementation of reject messages themselves printed unsanitized bytes to the logs and IIRC also didn't limit the size of strings, though I believe both of these were fixed before merge.  We have also had many PRs for where we broke sending reject messages (or sent the 'wrong' one)-- (PR #7179 comes to mind.)\r\n\r\nFor tests, we should eventually consider something more targeted. (I have thoughts there but it's too far a tangent for this discussion.-- My comment here was in vague support of your changes but also advising that I think we should be thinking about alternatives going forward.)\r\n",

We can send in invalid messages and assert that bitcoin rejected them for the right reason.\r\n\r\nAlso for things that do custom transaction broadcasting (for example [bitcoin-submittx](https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin-submittx) ) it's marginally useful to see if transactions have been accepted or not, and why.  I wouldn't care deeply if they were removed, though I don't see any urgency in doing so.\r\n\r\nThere were indeed some bugs in initial deployment of this feature (including, as I remember, one that could cause a reject message to be sent for a reject message), but I'd say those have been ironed out by now. Attack surface is mostly introduced by parsing/accepting messages not by emitting them, and we don't do anything with them besides optional logging (which could be in a separate logging category from NET).\r\n",
