If anybody can help with this it would be very welcomed.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot solve this soon or reverse_iterator.hpp is not acceptable even temporarily for some reason I suggest to go back to remove BOOST_FOREACH everywhere and #include <boost\\/foreach.hpp> everywhere except for the few places that use BOOST_REVERSE_FOREACH as a first step. But I hope we don't need to do that.\r\n",

And I think when it's run outside of travis thats what it should do, and it answers the above concerns... reviewers can check this without creating a gratuitous invisible script vector. ",

      "body" : "It seems some more general comments really belong in #10189 .\r\nI agree with the concerns. I think anyone giving an utACK to an \"scripted-diff\" (or whatever we chose as the prefix) commit should read the script and either review the changes (that's what I did for #10189) or run the script locally. Even if the script in #10189 facilitates review and will help travis warn you when your commit is not complete anymore after rebase (for example, because of new uses of something you are replacing), it is not a replacement for review. I think #10189 's script helps more writers than reviewers (I often want to do \"this and nothing else\" but some times more things end up in the same commit by accident), but it also establishes a clear format for commit messages for commits using scripts and that makes review easier (because reviewers can run the script themselves or at least review thinking the commit shouldn't do anything else than what the script says [although that king of review doesn't guarantee the change is complete]).\r\n\r\n@tjps I tried to remove PAIRTYPE but it seems Q_FOREACH needs it too.\r\nI'm removing Q_FOREACH too to see what people think it seems we may lose some performance with that, see https://www.dvratil.cz/2015/06/qt-containers-and-c11-range-based-loops/\r\nAlso, needed rebase.\r\n\r\nEDIT: @ipoptika reminder that \"UNDO: I really don't understand why this is failing\" should get out of the PR (solved somehow) before merging this",
