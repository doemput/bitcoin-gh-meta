The first commit is #10123__\r\n\r\n~__EDIT: reduced scope of this PR. I'm closing #10123 until #9424 is merged, but that shouldn't block reducing the test_framework log spam__~\r\n\r\nThis commit reduces spammy logging by the test framework and the\r\nbitcoind instances in a test run:\r\n\r\n- truncate logging send/receive message in mininode to 200 characters.\r\nmininode was previously logging the entire message sent received, which\r\ncan be up to 1MB for a full block.\r\n- exclude logging for leveldb and libevent in the bitcoind instances\r\n\r\nrequires #10123",
