   "body" : "Remove the 'state' and 'exceptmask' from serialize.h's stream implementations, as well as related methods.\r\n\r\nAs exceptmask always included 'failbit', and setstate was always called with bits = failbit, all it did was immediately raise an exception. Get rid of those variables, and replace the setstate with direct exception throwing (which also removes some dead code).\r\n\r\nAs a result, good() is never reached after a failure (there are only 2 calls, one of which is in tests), and can just be replaced by !eof().\r\n\r\nfail(), clear(n) and exceptions() are just never called. Delete them.\r\n\r\nLarger goal: simplify the serialize.h interfaces enough to make a planned refactor easier (I want to get rid of IMPLEMENT_SERIALIZE, and replace it with a single templated method).",
