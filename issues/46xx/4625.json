   "body" : "The first test in [src/test/data/sig_canonical.json](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6278bd57c662e29b07df9db50c47095c0bb44a82/src/test/data/sig_canonical.json#L2) is `300602010002010001` which equates to a signature of R=0 and S=0.\r\n\r\nThis is an invalid test since according to the ECDSA spec, a valid signature must be in the range [1, n-1].  Given 0 is not in that range, the signature in question is invalid and will be found as such during a verify.\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that a canonical test doesn't necessarily need to check this condition since it will fail during verification anyways, at the very least it seems like a bad idea to intentionally test an invalid signature is considered canonical.\r\n\r\nThe following comments from @sipa on IRC concur:\r\n\r\n> 12:33 < sipa> no, i mean, it's not necessary that the canonicality check verifies this, as normal signature verification would fail anyway\r\n> 12:34 < sipa> but i agree it's weird to have a 'slightly relaxed' definition for canonicality in the code, and test for it\r\n> 12:34 < sipa> thanks for reporting\r\n\r\nI would personally go further and change `IsCanonicalSignature` to consider a signature with an R or S value outside of the valid range as defined in the ECDSA spec as non-canonical and move the test in question to `sig_noncanonical.json`.  It is an extremely cheap check and, in my opinion, it's better to be paranoid.\r\n\r\nSo given the above, this issue can be resolved in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n* Simply remove the invalid signature from `sig_canonical.json`\r\n* Update `IsCanonicalSignature` to consider R=0, R >= N, S=0, and S >= N as a non-canonical signature and move the test to `sig_noncanonical.json`.  Perhaps then also add a couple more tests which contain R >= N and S >= N.",
