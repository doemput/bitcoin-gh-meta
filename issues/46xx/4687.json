   "body" : "While there is a command line option to limit the total number of\r\nconnections ('-maxconnections'), the number of outbound connections is\r\ncontrolled by a hard-coded constant 'MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS=8'.\r\nThis number (8) of connections has a bad impact on user's privacy. Let's\r\nkeep the default number of outbound connections (of 8) but allow a user\r\nto have more privacy by reducing this number (to 3 or 4) using\r\n'-maxoutbound'.\r\n\r\nExplanation: transactions that are first relayed by these 8 entry nodes\r\nmost probably belong to the same user. In fact, even a subset of these 8\r\nentry nodes can uniquely identify a user. There is a cheap way for an\r\nattacker to learn this set of entry nodes and the user's public IP and\r\nuse it to deanonymize the user (note that users by default advertise\r\ntheir public IP addresses even when behind NAT).  If the user has 3-4\r\noutbound connection the success rate of the attack becomes quite low.\r\nSome details are here: https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Bitcoin",
