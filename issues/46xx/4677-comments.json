The async forwarding of blocks simply starts propagating blocks upon receipt of a valid block header rather than waiting for the full block to be received.\r\n\r\nThere's *absolutely no difference* from what's being done now, except that the valid header serves as a \"go-ahead\" to start propagating the information received rather than waiting for the full block to arrive.\r\n\r\nIf the block hash is good enough to secure blocks, surely it's good enough to act as a signal that what's currently being received can be propagated.\r\n\r\nEDIT: And I'm not talking at all about miners beginning to mine the next block. I'm talking about O(1) propagation time for blocks they've already mined. Mining the next block can't be done until the full block is received, but this is separate from how quickly the block propagates the network in the first place; it's also separate from how efficiently we can communicate a block's information (which is what Gavin's proposal does)",

      "body" : "I proposed an idea to the dev list which is basically the same as this.  The subject was \"cut-through propagation of blocks\".  Essentially it follows the same principle that routers/switches do, by beginning to forward a packet after receiving only the header, rather than the slower store-and-forward approach.  As @pgrigor said, the change is compatible and complimentary to the IBLT work.\r\n\r\nHowever, this change can be done as a low-level optimisation to networking code, without needing to change the chain selection rule.  I.e. only count the block as \"seen\" once it is fully received and validated.  This way you get the benefits of the streaming propagation, without having to worry about the implications of changing the chain selection rule to consider partial blocks.  A far less controversial change.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting: I believe that implementing this change would require an enhancement to the p2p protocol to support multiplexing of messages.  Otherwise, someone can send a valid header but stall or slow the sending of the rest of the block in order to \"jam\" many of the connections in the network.  Multiplexing would allow for one block to stream slowly while other faster blocks can overtake it.\r\n\r\nAs discussed on the mailing list though, another option is to implement this as a separate project.  It could be an external process that connects locally to bitcoind using the p2p protocol, and acts as a bridge to send blocks to an alternative network which is designed for fast propagation.  Possibly the alternate network could use a different topology than a random mesh broadcast network, to speed things up even more.",
