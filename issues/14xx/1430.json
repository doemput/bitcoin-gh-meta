   "body" : "I have no proxy setup on my local machine, so setting one will for sure not work and is intended to reproduce this.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. start Bitcoin-Qt (compiled from current master)\n2. enable proxy and use default settings\n3. exit\n4. restart Bitcoin-Qt\n5. exit\n6. crash\n\ndebug.log shows in the end:\nsocket select error 10022\nERROR: GetMyExternalIP() : connection to 216.146.39.70:80 failed\nBitcoin exited\nselect() for connection failed: 10038\nERROR: GetMyExternalIP() : connection to 212.117.175.194:80 failed\nThreadOpenConnections exited\n\nSo I guess it has to do with ThreadOpenConnections not cleanly exiting, perhaps because we don't detect or handle such connection problems. This needs a deep look by @sipa I think.\n\nBtw. the proxy setting in the Qt GUI needs a re-start, right? It's not changed on the fly?",
