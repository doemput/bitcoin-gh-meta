   "body" : "I noticed that the new 'Immature balance' label is not updated correctly when they actually mature. In fact, also the normal 'balance' label is not updated correctly.\n\nObserved behavior:\n1) When starting bitcoin-qt all is well: The mined transactions below 120 confirmations are added and listed 'immature', the rest of the transactions are added and listed under 'balance'.\n2) When a block is received in which new coins are mined they are added to the 'immature balance'. So far so good.\n3) When a block is received pushing the number of confirmations of a mined transaction above 120, this transaction's icon is changed to a green V, but its value is not deducted from the immature balance, and it is also not added to the regular balance. The only way to have it display correctly is to restart bitcoin-qt, as then one goes to situation 1) again.\n\nDesired behavior:\nThe labels should reflect the correct balance/immature balance at all times, according to the currently downloaded and verified (and matured) blocks.",
