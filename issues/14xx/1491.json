   "body" : "Hi!\n\nI set up bitcoin for the first time. Someone gave me 0.01 btc. As a test I wanted to send 1 ubtc. The client said:\n\n\"This transaction is over the size limit.  You can still send it for a fee of 0.0005, which goes to the nodes that process your transaction and helps to support the network.  Do you want to pay the fee?\"\n\nThe example transaction in https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transactions has 378 bytes. I don't believe my transaction was over 10.000 bytes. Rather I believe, the fee was enforced because the output was smaller than 0.01 btc.\n\nPlease write the correct reason for the fee when asking for the fee.\n\n",
