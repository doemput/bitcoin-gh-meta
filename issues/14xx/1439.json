   "body" : "This pull is based on a discussion with @TheBlueMatt and @laanwj.\n\n- introduce a new StartShutdown() function, which starts a thread with Shutdown() if no GUI is used and calls uiInterface.QueueShutdown() if a GUI is used\n- all direct uiInterface.QueueShutdown() calls are replaced with StartShutdown() - this ensures a clean GUI shutdown, even when catching a SIGTERM and allows the BitcoinGUI destructor to get called (which fixes a tray-icon issue and keeps the tray-icon until Bitcoin-Qt exits)\n\nThe current implementation (current master branch) sometimes crashes Bitcoin-Qt (bad) and doesn't allow GUI object destructors do their work as we call exit() in Shutdown(), which leads to an unremoved tray-icon (as visible bug).\n\nI'm sure we could remove some ``#include \"ui_interface.h\"`` in the modified files, but I was not really sure about that, so input is welcome.\n\nFixes: #1182",
