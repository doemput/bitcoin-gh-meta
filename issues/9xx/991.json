Can we get an IPC solution that doesn't require monkey-patching boost::interprocess ?\r\n2. I'm nervous that attackers might be able to craft bitcoin: URIs that Do Bad Things. I would suggest that we disable Linux bitcoin: URI handling until that is fixed, but I consider bitcoin: URI handling on Linux experimental anyway because users have to know how to manually enable it.\r\n",
