   "body" : "Every day or two I run a script to move bitcoins between local and remote wallets.  The script hasn't been changed since 16th Feb, but one time when I ran it a few days ago it sent coins from the \"\" account, not the one I told it to.\r\n\r\nThe script runs:\r\nbitcoind sendfrom name $address $amount\r\n\r\nwhich should debit the \"name\" account.  And every time except for one that's what it did.  Now, however, if I check the balance of the \"name\" account, it is too high by the amount I transferred the time it went wrong, and if I \"listtransactions\" the transaction in question has:\r\n.        \"account\" : \"\",\r\ninstead of\r\n.        \"account\" : \"name\",\r\n\r\nI don't know how to get this to happen again - it's been fine for 6 months, only going wrong this one time.  It has been working again since the time it went wrong.\r\n\r\nI doubt it matters, but this is the script I use.  It's in a Makefile, so most of the $'s are doubled up:\r\n\r\n\r\nmove:\r\n\t@x=$$($(BITCOIND) getbalance name 0) || exit;\t\\\r\n\t echo $$x | sed -E 's/[.]?00000000$$//';\t\\\r\n\t echo -n \"amount: \"; read Y; Y0=$$Y\"00000000\";\t\\\r\n\t echo \"send $$Y BTC to $(ADDRESS)?\";\t\t\\\r\n\t echo -n \"wallet passphrase: \"; read X; echo;\t\t\\\r\n\t $(BITCOIND) walletpassphrase \"$$X\" 300 &&\t\\\r\n\t ($(BITCOIND) sendfrom name $(ADDRESS) $$Y;\t\\\r\n\t  $(BITCOIND) walletlock;\t\t\t\\\r\n\t  ssh server \"echo \\\"$$(date) - received $$Y BTC at $(ADDRESS)\\\" >> wallet.log\";\t\\\r\n\t  $(BITCOIND) getbalance name 0 |\t\t\\\r\n\t  sed 's/00000000$$//')\r\n",
