In the past I have run `bitcored` from bitpay, which comes with its own bitcoind executable, `Bitcoin version v0.11.2.0-bc99ef3 (2016-04-08 10:42:17 -0400)`. I suppose that could be statically linked with a different leveldb version, and may be contributing to the behavior I'm seeing, since I run it on the same ~/.bitcoin/ directory.\r\n\r\nI'll can rebuilding from older commits and see if I can determine which commit introduced the behavior if that would be helpful.",
