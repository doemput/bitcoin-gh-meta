Lets hope this changes after we had the\ndiscussion in last weeks meeting and after deleting the unused script.\nSo there is only one script left with a description on how to use it.\nThough, I am not interested in enforcing the use of clang format, also\nI won't highlight any style nits in pulls, as I think it would be\ndistracting.\n\nIn regard to this pull, I think this is better placed in some meta\nrepository, so we can use it whenever appropriate but don't confuse\nregular developers by the number of scripts we put in the devtools\nsubdir.\n\nI submitted a pull request to the maintainers repo to archive the old\nversion: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/pull/7\nI think your script does fit really well into that repo as well.\n",

An efficient workflow to cut down on TravisCI round trips would also include running a pass of the same scripts on individual work machines, so having them easily available is a plus. To me, that is more of a 'developer' task rather than a 'maintainer' task - albeit an optional one at present.\r\n\r\nThe next task I am looking at is to bring the four scripts I have written into one subdirectory modeled after the rpc tests in `qa/`. I wish to consolidate the repeated code and make better OO abstractions for future extensions. Also, for the same PR, I hope to have it all working inside TravisCI in a report-information-only capacity. At that time we could decide to make it live in a different repo if it isn't too much trouble importing it for TravisCI runs on `bitcoin/bitcoin`.",
