So we'll add an AC_DEFINE(something) line there.\r\n\r\nShould we call it \"TARGET_OPENBSD\", does that make sense, or should we give it some other name? \"USE_ARC4RANDOM\"?? Please advise @theuni , @TheBlueMatt , @sipa and others, thanks!\r\n\r\nWill follow up to your response, with a mature pull request.",

The preference would be to bypass arc4random (which as discussed above is a risk on some platforms), and to use the syscalls directly when available to get randomness directly from the kernel. `GetOSRandom` could use:\r\n\r\n- `getrandom(buf, buflen, 0)` on Linux\r\n- `getentropy(buf, buflen)` on OpenBSD\r\n- `sysctl(KERN_ARND)` on FreeBSD and NetBSD\r\n\r\nOther BSDs may have one of these too. Unlike for arc4random we can simply detect availability of these in the build system without worrying about the specific platform.",
