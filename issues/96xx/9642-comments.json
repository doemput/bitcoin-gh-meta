Provided the hardfork is accepted by consensus, that can be any time up until after passes 1 MB (assuming the current BIP9 timeout is used). If activated today (which is obviously not going to happen, since the hardfork hasn't been accepted), the block weight limit today would be 600k (with both segwit and non-segwit benefitting from the discount), but the block size limit of 300k would hold no matter what the weight is - so it would be 70% as @jl2012 said (again, only in the hypothetical of a present-day activation, which can't realistically happen).\r\n\r\nI've done some updates to [the BIP draft text](https://github.com/luke-jr/bips/blob/bip-blksize/bip-blksize.mediawiki) in hopes of clarifying how the activation works, and why I think this BIP should be entirely uncontroversial (insofar as the hardfork itself is concerned; contention over the \"stage 2\" activation is a separate matter).",

To minimize any possible controversy, you should simply remove the reduction stage, so people may agree to lock-in earlier without side effect.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn't prohibit you from proposing an independent softfork that reduce the the block size for the following 7 years.",
