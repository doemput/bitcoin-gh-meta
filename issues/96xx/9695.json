Going forward (post 0.14), we can clean these up so that they're not all individual atomic accesses.\r\n\r\n- Reintroduce cs_vRecv to guard receive-specific vars\r\n- Lock vRecv/vSend for CNodeStats\r\n- Make some vars atomic.\r\n- Only set the connection time in CNode's constructor so that it doesn't change",
