You can see the reindex command or copy another good copy from somewhere - there are many how-to's and the docs explain it well. Of course you can also make a backup or snapshot of the current blockchain (and wallet) just in case.\r\nBut as far as this RPC server issue is concerned, I think you could close it because it unfortunately is what I suspected (RPC server doesn't start).",
