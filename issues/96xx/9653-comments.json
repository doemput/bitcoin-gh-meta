      "body" : "@Leviathn, I doubt we can ever agree on when to name the version 1.0.0\ninstead of 0.XX.XX. Right now Bitcoin Core is doing a rolling release\nabout every 6 months (and minor releases whenever applicable). The\nversion number pretty much only tells in what order the releases were\nmade.\n\nThe difficulty to decide when to tag it version 1.0.0 arises when you\nrealize that Bitcoin Core is pretty much a massive bundle of different\nmodules (c.f. the folders in /src or the slide at\nhttps://youtu.be/8BLWUUPfh2Q?t=2h46m19s). And even if you could decide\nfor a single of those modules that it reached version 1.0.0, we can\njust put \"Bitcoin Core 21.0.0 comes bundled with a stable release of\nCore Wallet 1.0.0\" in the release notes, even though other parts of\nthe software may be less mature than most stable part at that time.\n\nLets jut get rid of the idea that a semi-arbitrary number that happens\nto denote the version of a Bitcoin Core release implies that the\nmaturity of the software or even of the whole Bitcoin network is\nreached. Otherwise, when version 1.0.0 means \"stable\", does 2.0.0 mean\n\"more stable\"? If so, we can just use 15.0 and 16.0 and say \"a larger\nnumber implies that the sofware is (slightly) more stable\". In this\ncontext, Matts proposal to use the number of commits makes most sense,\nbut I think sticking with the existing process and just increment the\nnumber every release is easier to handle.\n\nI think dropping the 0 prefix is the easiest way to get rid of the\nregular discussion to bump to 1.0.0.\n",

Version numbers are pretty important for users!\r\n\r\nI think that overall an acceptable \"compromise\" would be to jump versions by a few and release 0.14 as Bitcoin 17 to mean Bitcoin 2017. If there are multiple releases intended in a given year, then it should be marked as YY.MM, eg 17.02 for a release in February 2017. This is how Ubuntu does it IIRC, and it works pretty well I think (we'd never really do 2 versions in a month...). A downside is that if, for some reason, there is no release for a year you skip a version number! Any releases can be handled as a counter at the end, e.g., 17.02.011, 17.02.012.\r\n\r\n",

We have a strictly time-based release process: a major release every 6 months, minor releases as necessary. Every major release, the second number is increased. This is completely predictable and requires zero discussion, which makes it very efficient.\r\n\r\nAs there are always two major releases per year,  this also means that @JeremyRubin's idea to go to purely year-month based version numbers isn't that crazy. For major releases, minor releases would still get a `.x` as they are fixups to older releases. This is the same for Ubuntu: `Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (Trusty Tahr)`. First number is the year, second the month of that (major) release, third number is the update (\"point-release\").",
