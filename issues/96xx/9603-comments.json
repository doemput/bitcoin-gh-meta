      "body" : "First, let's define an _cosmetic issue_ as an issue for which a fix wouldn't change the possible code paths taken at runtime (think unchanged binary). Cosmetic issues would then include things such as trailing whitespace, tabs instead of spaces, etc.\r\n\r\nSecond, \r\n* Why do we want to add a linter? Is the goal to catch cosmetic problems, non-cosmetic problems or both?\r\n* What would be the incremental gain of adding a C++ linter?\r\n* What would be the incremental gain of adding a Python linter?\r\n* Do we strive to achieve the same level of assurance from Travis CI regarding the code quality after a passed Travis CI build regardless of the language of the code changed in a newly submitted PR?\r\n\r\nIn C++ land we can assume that most non-cosmetic problems (\"real issues\") that would be uncovered by a good linter are likely already covered by the compiler's warnings/errors. The incremental gain of adding a C++ linter would likely be limited to improved style consistency of the code base.\r\n\r\nIn Python land the situation is quite different. Adding a Python linter to the Travis CI build process would help us uncover real non-cosmetic issues that otherwise could go unnoticed until runtime (`NameError`:s, logic errors due to inconsistent indentation, etc.).\r\n\r\nI think there is a really strong case for adding a Python linter that would be finely tuned to catch only real non-cosmetic issues and disregard all styling issues. That would increase the level of assurance given by a passed Travis CI build at a very low cost.",
