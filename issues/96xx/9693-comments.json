Do you have a `test_bitcoin_fuzzy` test case to share that triggers this issue?\r\n\r\nI'm doing some bitcoin fuzzing myself and I'm curious to roughly how many CPU months that went into finding this issue and more specifically how many total paths that had been reached before finding this (the number printed at `overall results/total paths` assuming `afl-fuzz`)?\r\n\r\nFrom my experience the code paths that can be reached using `test_bitcoin_fuzzy` seem to be very very robust :-)\r\n\r\nBTW, are there any known plans to submit a `test_bitcoin_fuzzy` based fuzzer to https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz?\r\n\r\nI'm really interested in fuzzing `bitcoind` and I'd love to share corpora. I've done some fuzzing of the Apple Swift compiler using my own fuzzer - see [results](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Amerged%20author%3Apracticalswift%20crasher) and [@practicalswift for some context](https://twitter.com/practicalswift).",
