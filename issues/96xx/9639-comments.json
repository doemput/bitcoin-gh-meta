This would require that your design is flexible to adapt colors according to the used scheme.\r\n\r\nI guess the Linux users would not be happy if we would force them to a pre-given scheme (force setting the Bitcoin-Core GUI colors). Also, this could be complex to achieve because I guess there are some internal control colors that need hacks to change.",

Its a more subtle change which will arguably upset less people - there will always be upset people when you change design :)\r\n\r\nAnyway i thought id share the mockup i made for anyone who was interested.

Above or below you can put the appropriate widgets (e.g. the Send widget described above would belong to the Outgoing column), then the overview page should be pretty full :-)    ",
