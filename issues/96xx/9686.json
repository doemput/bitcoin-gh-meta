   "body" : "When writing help output in the RPC commands, people tend to align in the editor. Escaped stuff messes this up on the output end. E.g.\r\n```\r\n\" \\\"foohash\\\" : \\\"hash\\\" (string, required) The foo hash.\\n\"\r\n\" \\\"bar\\\" : n            (numeric, required) The bar.\\n\"\r\n```\r\nwhich results in\r\n```\r\n \"foohash\" : \"hash\" (string, required) The foo hash.\r\n \"bar\" : n            (numeric, required) The bar.\r\n```\r\nPeople could try to align for output, but this is hard to get right and requires recompiling every try. I am proposing a simple tabulation function that parses the input string, aligning everything into left of and right of a delimiter (currently `\" || \"`).\r\n\r\nIs this a reasonable idea? I am not too concerned about performance with this addition, except for the \"help\" case which runs every single command, but it should be pretty much instant on most machines even with parsing overhead.",
