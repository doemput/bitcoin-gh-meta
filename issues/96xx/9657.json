   "body" : "rpc-tests.py was converted from a shell script into python in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6616 and it shows. There are several idioms which make sense for a shell script, but are considered bad practice in a python module. This PR cleans up some of the quirks.\r\n\r\nThis pull request combines several commits which improve the code style of rpc-tests.py and move away from bad practices. Reviews/comments for any or all of the commits are welcomed:\r\n\r\n- commit 1 replaces the tests_config module and `from tests_config import *` wildcard import with a .ini file and the Python standard library configparser module. Benefits are:\r\n    - config lives in config files and code lives in source files. Duh.\r\n    - avoids a wildcard import, which are usually considered bad practice because it's difficult to know where names are binded.\r\n    - replaces some of the ugly workarounds in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8133 - doesn't leave a compiled tests_config.pyc file lying around, doesn't add qa/pull_tester to the python path, allows rpc_tests.py to be run from anywhere.\r\n- commit 2 replaces the roll-your-own argument parsing code with Python3's standard library argparse module. Benefits are:\r\n    - more compact, cleaner code\r\n    - passing unknown arguments down to the individual test scripts and selecting which individual test scripts to run is now cleaner\r\n    - it should be easier and less bug-prone to add new arguments in future\r\n- commit 3 makes a few miscellaneous improvements to rpc-test.py's arguments:\r\n    - make all arguments start with double dash for consistency. I don't expect those arguments were being called by automatic tools, so this shouldn't break any build/test processes.\r\n    - improve help text and output\r\n    - add nozmq argument to explicitly exclude the ZMQ tests\r\n- commit 4 removes global variables and places logic in main(). Benefits:\r\n    - allows rpc-tests.py to be imported and runtests() to be called by external modules.\r\n\r\n[EDIT: removed commit hashes since I've now rebased]",
