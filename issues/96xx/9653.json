   "body" : "In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8455#issuecomment-276054487 the versioning of Bitcoin Core was mentioned, but deemed off-topic, so I am creating this issue to address the fact that Bitcoin Core uses a non-traditional scheme for version releases.\r\n\r\nTo me, the first (traditionally \"major\") version number is `0` for as long as a product is considered non-production-ready, and `>0` for production-ready, and bears significant meaning in this sense.\r\n\r\nPossible mind-sets:\r\n\r\n1. It is agreed that Bitcoin Core is past beta stage, even if blockchains and crypto-currencies are new technologies. The initial `0.` is dropped, meaning that the next version is `14.0` not `0.14.0`.\r\n2. A set of milestones leading up to a 'production ready' version of Bitcoin Core are established, and this is referred to as the `1.0` release.\r\n3. This discussion is irrelevant.\r\n",
