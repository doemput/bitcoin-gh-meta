   "body" : "According to comments on the Web the Gitian Building [doc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md) could be better and I agree.\r\nI don't want to create a PR that will invite too many requests for changes, so I thought to check with others interested in fixing that doc.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts: the LXC approach isn't well documented and doesn't work. Related to containers, there's also a Docker-related [link](https://github.com/gdm85/tenku/tree/master/docker/gitian-bitcoin-host/README.md) to an external repo that provides additional information which isn't helpful as it used to be since the external resource hasn't been updated for almost 2 years. \r\nAnother issue is it appears that both the LXC and KVM approach work well, whereas in reality the LXC approach almost certainly doesn't. \r\n\r\nProposal: \r\n\r\n* Make it obvious the KVM approach is the preferred approach, and slightly de-emphasize LXC until other contributors improve it. If there's a LXC or Docker enthusiast here who wants to work on this together, we don't have to de-emphasize LXC - we can just improve the existing document and make it usable for LXC and/or Docker. If somebody wants to write it, I'm willing to help with testing or feedback.\r\n* Clarify and improve the KVM related procedure. I'm almost done with this part.\r\n ",
