   "body" : "This pull request enables most compilation warnings (of -Wall -Wextra) and fixes them. I compiled bitcoin-qt with g++ and clang to have as much warning coverage as possible.  Warning flags in bitcoin-qt and bitcoind build have been equalized.\r\n\r\n`char-subscripts` warnings were especially dangerous, as char can be negative, resulting in accesses outside the array and thus potential information leakage. Fixed this by adding (unsigned char).\r\n\r\nI've left these warnings alone:\r\n\r\n* `invalid-offsetof`: Looked this up, and found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1129894/why-cant-you-use-offsetof-on-non-pod-strucutures-in-c\r\nWe use none of the special C++ multi-inheritance and dynamic casting so using `offsetof` should be safe. \r\n* `sign-compare`:  There's just too darn many of 'em. These could be worth checking later, as wrong signed-unsigned comparisons can result in nasty bugs.\r\n* `unused-parameter`: Also way too many instances. And ignoring a parameter is no problem, usually.\r\n\r\nI have carefully seperated this into commits for each separate warning class to make review easy.\r\n\r\n",
