   "body" : "It occurs to me that this happens as the node asks several other nodes for the same blocks when it does not see the block appear within a certain time. Due to the speed of the nodes providing blocks, they both respond with the blocks requested, but one will send the block first and usually stay ahead. This isn't a major issue, but it does mean that bandwidth is wasted, and since it's probably the bandwidth which is causing the problem in the first place, I expect this will continue to get worse due to being a vicious circle. My proposed solution probably requires a BIP, which would allow a node to request to another node to stop sending blocks (i.e. to the node sending the blocks which it already has). It could do this after one duplicate block, or perhaps after several.\r\n\r\nSample case:\r\n\r\n04/17/12 22:08:49 askfor block 000000000000096fd80c   0\r\n04/17/12 22:08:50 sending getdata: block 000000000000096fd80c\r\n04/17/12 22:14:12 askfor block 000000000000096fd80c   1334700530000000\r\n04/17/12 22:14:12 sending getdata: block 000000000000096fd80c\r\n04/17/12 22:16:39 received block 000000000000096fd80c\r\n04/17/12 22:16:40 SetBestChain: new best=000000000000096fd80c  height=176035  work=29615794588444859740\r\n04/17/12 22:20:07 received block 00000000000009856606\r\n04/17/12 22:20:07 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176020 00000000000009856606\r\n04/17/12 22:20:56 received block 00000000000008862df7\r\n04/17/12 22:20:56 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176021 00000000000008862df7\r\n04/17/12 22:21:36 received block 000000000000035a84ac\r\n04/17/12 22:21:36 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176022 000000000000035a84ac\r\n04/17/12 22:21:59 received block 0000000000000a881c26\r\n04/17/12 22:21:59 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176023 0000000000000a881c26\r\n04/17/12 22:22:18 received block 00000000000004ed81e6\r\n04/17/12 22:22:18 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176024 00000000000004ed81e6\r\n04/17/12 22:22:52 received block 000000000000068bbe48\r\n04/17/12 22:22:52 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176025 000000000000068bbe48\r\n04/17/12 22:23:12 received block 00000000000003425f71\r\n04/17/12 22:23:12 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176026 00000000000003425f71\r\n04/17/12 22:23:39 received block 00000000000000f89962\r\n04/17/12 22:23:39 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176027 00000000000000f89962\r\n04/17/12 22:23:48 received block 000000000000083ec278\r\n04/17/12 22:23:48 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176028 000000000000083ec278\r\n04/17/12 22:24:06 received block 000000000000088984c6\r\n04/17/12 22:24:06 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176029 000000000000088984c6\r\n04/17/12 22:24:29 received block 00000000000002857e8b\r\n04/17/12 22:24:29 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176030 00000000000002857e8b\r\n04/17/12 22:24:45 received block 000000000000075834ed\r\n04/17/12 22:24:45 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176031 000000000000075834ed\r\n04/17/12 22:25:10 received block 000000000000033b7b3e\r\n04/17/12 22:25:10 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176032 000000000000033b7b3e\r\n04/17/12 22:25:56 received block 00000000000001f32a95\r\n04/17/12 22:25:56 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176033 00000000000001f32a95\r\n04/17/12 22:26:20 received block 00000000000004dffd6d\r\n04/17/12 22:26:20 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176034 00000000000004dffd6d\r\n04/17/12 22:26:20 received block 000000000000096fd80c\r\n04/17/12 22:26:20 ERROR: ProcessBlock() : already have block 176035 000000000000096fd80c\r\n\r\nMuch of this output has been cut, but if I grep my debug.log for \"already have\", I can see that blocks 174591 to 176061 (1470 blocks and counting) were being sent by two nodes.",
