This needs careful scrutiny though.\r\n\r\nEdit: also added commit to change type of CMerkleTx::fMerkleVerified (and other in-memory-only flags) from char to bool. It is always (only 3 occurences) used as bool, so this is better.\r\n\r\nEdit.2: also removed some GUI hints in the bitcoin core, which were remnants from Wx.\r\n",
