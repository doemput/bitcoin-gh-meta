This could become more of a problem in the future as the network grows and the same transactions is gossiped around the network for a while.\n\nIs it worth creating a memory pool of rejected blocks and transactions? Perhaps keeping only their hash rather than the whole block or transaction? This way, bandwidth can be saved for all nodes (at some small expense of memory storing the \"ignore list\").\n",
