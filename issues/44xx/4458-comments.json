      "body" : "I think perhaps more importantly than it simply accepting an odd length (which there is nothing wrong with) is the fact it's accepting hex with invalid characters in it.  In particular, the character at the end of the submission is `0xa0`.  Note: That's not `0x0a` (`\\n`).\r\n\r\nAs a test, I submitted the byte sequence `0x22, 0x30, 0x32, 0xa0, 0x22` which is `\"02Ã¯Â¿Â½\"` to both `decodescript` and `submitblock`.  Obviously the two `\"` will be stripped during the JSON unmarshal.\r\n\r\nThe call to `decodescript` gives: `-8: argument must be hexadecimal string (not '02Ã¯Â¿Â½')` which is what one would expect when submitting invalid hex.  However, the same data passed to `submitblock` gives: `-22: Block decode failed` meaning it's accepting the invalid hex and passing it on block decoding.",
