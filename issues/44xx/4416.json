   "body" : "testnet3 is getting extremely long in the tooth; the difficulty is sky high and there's a lot of very large blocks that have bloated the chain up to 1.4GB. New syncs take a very long time due to runs of these large blocks. \r\n\r\nIs it reasonable to push a new testnet version as part of 0.10? Possibly with better difficulty rules than testnet3, the \"drop the difficulty for one block\" decision seems to cause more problems than it solves. ",
