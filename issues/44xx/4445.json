   "body" : "1. In Help -> Debug Window (which is the main window in -nowallet mode), on the Information tab, the \"Number of connections\" list incoming connections as \"Out\" (the nodes which you download blocks from) and outgoing ones as \"In\" (the ones you provide with blockchain info). Excuse me if I got it twisted, but I think it should be the other way around.\r\n\r\n2. Same window, Network Traffic tab: the naming is proper here, but I propose assigning color red  to \"In\" and green to \"Out\". This follows the logic of: \"In\" - \"leeching\" - \"bad\" - red, \"Out\" - \"seeding\" - \"good\" - green; subtly implying that it is important to keep a full node running and helping the network with data over longer time, instead of just hit-n-running. Lots of \"red\" will communicate this to the user, and lots of \"green\" will give a sense of satisfaction and inspiration to keep the node running (however corny sounding it is in words).",
