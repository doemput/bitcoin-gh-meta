ProcessMessage(\"tx\") locks cs_main and then can call pfrom->PushMessage if it rejects the tx.  PushMessage() obtains pnode->cs_vSend.  Another example: CheckBlock() will lock cs_main and then can call PushGetBlocks() which does a call to PushMessage() which locks pnode->cs_vSend.\n- As far as I can tell, there is just a single execution path that obtains these locks in the opposite order: ThreadMessageHandler() locks pnode->cs_vSend and then calls SendMessages() which locks cs_main in order to call IsInitialBlockDownload().\n\nThe least painful fix seems to be to change the SendMessages() code to not need cs_main.  Otherwise, ThreadMessageHandler() would need to lock cs_main prior to its SendMessages calls, which might be expensive use of the lock.  Any ideas on making the IsInitialBlockDownload() check available to SendMessages() without it having to lock cs_main every time?  Maybe caching it is possible?\n",
