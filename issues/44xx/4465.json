   "body" : "- fix bug in CWallet::CreateTransaction. If dPriorityNeeded is -1, then dPriority >= dPriorityNeeded is always true,\r\n  so we always \"break;\"\r\n- CFeeRate::GetFee(..) currently returns zero for very small nSatoshisPerK.\r\n  For example, if you set the voluntary fee to 1 satoshi, and the tx has less than 1000 bytes,\r\n  payTxFee.GetFee(nTxBytes) returns zero, this results in CWallet::GetMinimumFee(..) to return\r\n  pool.estimateFee(..) instead of the voluntary fee. So its not possible to set the voluntary fee as low as 1 satoshi.\r\n- Add fallback hard-coded AllowFree to coin control, because CreateTransaction also does.\r\n- Handle voluntary fee case in coin control. nPayFee was set to zero if\r\n  dPriority >= dPriorityNeeded, even in the voluntary fee case. And we need to consider, that\r\n  CreateTransaction pays at least for 1000 bytes in the voluntary fee case.\r\n\r\nJust a question, why did -mintxfee move from Testing options to Wallet options?\r\nI dont think we should bother people with this, otherwise we wouldnt need smart fee in the first place.",
