Some sort of ridiculously long hash key that a computer generates. Those millions of \"Bitcoins\" are then sold at auction online, immediate cash is generated to further fund the project.\r\n\r\nEveryone would agree to this hash, so all the coins could be VERIFIED with a computer code.\r\nAs long as no one can duplicate the coins, this model works, correct?\r\n\r\nInflation would not occur, only 21 million coins were issued. Works just like the Bitcoin model and you don't have to wait till 2032 or whatever!\r\n\r\nAlso transactions are now instant! PROBLEM SOLVED",
