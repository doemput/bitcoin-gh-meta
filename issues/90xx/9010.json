   "body" : "Split up AppInit2 into multiple steps: This allows doing some of the steps before daemonization and some later.\n\nTo avoid the issue described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9009#issuecomment-255988169:\n- Before daemonization, just probe the data directory lock and print an early error message if possible.\n- After daemonization get the data directory lock again and hold on to it until exit. This creates a slight window for a race condition to happen, however this condition is harmless: it will at most make the process exit without printing a message to console as it will be detected after daemonization.\n\nSolves #9009:\n\n```\n$ src/bitcoind -testnet -daemon\nBitcoin server starting\n$ src/bitcoind -testnet -daemon\nError: Cannot obtain a lock on data directory /home/orion/.bitcoin/testnet3. Bitcoin Core is probably already running.\n```\n\nAs for the AppInit2 split: This is something I've been wanting to do for a while. Note that, to reduce risk of regressions, this is just mechanic code movement and doesn't change ordering, besides the `daemon()` invocation.\n\nSome smarter things could be done such as:\n- Move basic context initialization from `AppInitBasicSetup()` to `SetupEnvironment()` where possible, especially things such as the windows DEP activation\n- Unify `InitParameterInteraction()` and `AppInitParameterInteraction()` if/where possible. I'm not sure why this is done in two steps with just `AppInitBasicSetup()` in between right now.\n- Do something smarter than `// Variables internal to initialization process only` (e.g. an initialization context structure). Some variables there may be completely avoided by moving the code to extract the arguments.\n- Splitting up further steps, this will allow factoring out `ENABLE_WALLET` sections from `libbitcoin_server.a` (which contains init.cpp) and remove the circular dependencies (#7965)\n- It is now possible to do unit testing on our initialization steps in isolation.\n\nHowever I do not intend to do these things in this pull.\n",
