Lately I have the feeling no one is running the rpc tests anymore and travis is our only tester, which is suboptimal, as a segfault slipped through and existed for several weeks.\r\n\r\nI think we should work to get any false positives out of the rpc test suite sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nJust a few points, some of which seem to have caused this Exception in the past:\r\n* Are there any \"zombie\" regtest nodes running?\r\n* Are there leftover folders/files in the tempdir you are using?\r\n* Is there enough space in the tempdir and RAM for the fullblocktest?",
