      "body" : "@laanwj Thanks for the clarification. Would you be willing to elaborate on why it would be too late to do so at activation?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I could elaborate on my reason for my question - it seems unnecessary that before activation 0.13.1 nodes are being relied upon so much - for sure, nodes need to be ready to be selective once activation occurs, but this doesn't mean that they need to be selective now. For example, why not let them continue downloading blocks from pre-0.13.1 nodes? As long as they have a connection to some 0.13.1 nodes, they are ready to be selective.",
