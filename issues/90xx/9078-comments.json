I can identify the spent outputs via the address and amount.  The scriptPubKey may be correct as well.  It lists all my real unspent outputs as well, with correct txid and number of confirmations.  The sum of the unspent values from real transactions equals what getbalance reports without the argument, i.e. the real balance.  The older version will only list the real unspent outputs, not any of the bogus ones.",

Any 'account' that shows up as non-zero has a new deposit. I then 'move' that amount to the default account and process the deposit in my application (which tracks the balance).\r\n\r\nSo rather than thinking that people are looking for an accounting system, what if we were just wanting to know when a deposit arrived, and when it disappeared again due to a reorg?
