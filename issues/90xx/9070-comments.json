The original algorithm is quadratic, but walking the chunk map is very fast. On my test system, total time it takes (in seconds) for a series of `n` allocs is approximated by `(1/30000000)n^2`; it reaches 100ms at around 1.7k allocs and 1s at around 5k allocs. The new algorithm should be loglinear for alloc sequences.",
