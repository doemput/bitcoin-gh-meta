But I suppose there could be a use case for bitcoind as a system background service even there and this would be the issue to refer to.\r\n\r\nThis could take the form of external scripts/wrappers, similar to that for Linux distributions in [contrib/init](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/init).\r\n",
