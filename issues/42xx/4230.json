   "body" : "I'm hoping to get some feedback on this.  It was mentioned by @gmaxwell that there is a 100ms sleep inside ThreadMessageHandler() which can delay the receiving and sending of network messages.  By replacing this with a semaphore, it can hopefully improve block propagation times.\r\n\r\nI haven't experienced any connections stalling with this patch, so it seems to work, and the ThreadMessageHandler() loop executed about 10 times per second on average when I tested with 8 peers.\r\n\r\nThere is still a lot of overhead since each execution of the loop does a scan of all nodes to check for new messages to send/receive, which I believe will happen every time there is a post() done on the semaphore. But, I haven't noticed any additional CPU load with this patch. \r\n\r\nI am yet to test how this effects block propagation.  Does anyone have a testing environment where you can roll out patches and test their effect on block latency?",
