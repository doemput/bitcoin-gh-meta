   "body" : "I have come to a solution to the first of my issues with [a deterministic build in LXC containers](https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder/issues/53): while trying to figure out why the source archive would have a different hash, I noticed that the sort output of the VirtualBox VM would differ from the sort output of the LXC container VM. See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/gdm85/82d1dfccde323290e8c2).\r\n\r\nThe solution is fairly simple: instead of sort, use numeric sorting + stable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsort -n -s\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the man page:\r\n```\r\n  -n, --numeric-sort\r\n              compare according to string numerical value\r\n  -s, --stable\r\n              stabilize sort by disabling last-resort comparison\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith my testcase (connecting via ssh and doing a sort) using these 2 options gave me same results on both LXC and VM.\r\n\r\nThe change needs to be applied to the gitian-linux.yml (and actually everywhere else the sort command is being used!), and yes - it will change the hashes, but for the better of determinism.",
