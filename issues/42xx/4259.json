The previous discussion could be checked here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4215.\r\n\r\nIn the LookupIntern(), things changed are:\r\n  1. Call getaddrinfo_a() instead of getaddrinfo() if available, the former is a sync version of the latter;\r\n  2. Try using inet_pton()/inet_addr() to convert the input text to a network addr structure at first, if success the extra name resolving thread inside getaddrinfo_a() could be avoided;\r\n  3. An interruption point added in the waiting loop for return from getaddrinfo_a(), which completes the improve for thread responsiveness.\r\n\r\nA easy way to see the effect is to kick off a 'bitcoind stop' immediately after 'bitcoind -daemon', before the change it would take several, or even tens of, minutes on a bad network situation to wait for the running bitcoind to exit, now it costs only seconds.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Huang Le <4tarhl@gmail.com>",
