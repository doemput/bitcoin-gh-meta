The first PR would cover the `-estlog` option and writing the fee estimation data to disk. The second PR would be for a tool to read and graph the logs.\r\n\r\nParsing and graphing json files seems like a problem that has probably been solved many times before. If I was approaching this, I'd look at implementing this as a script in /contrib or a separate repository. Was there a particular reason you chose to implement this as a new C++ program?",
