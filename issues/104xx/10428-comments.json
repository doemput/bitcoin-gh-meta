Activation is done by economic majority, the reason one may want to use an optional parameter is because measuring if the network has reached a suitable economic majority is not as straight forward as measuring signalling blocks, one should activate the flag once they are confident a suitable percentage of the economy intends to activate the flag. The fork is convergent as long as there is an economic majority or miner majority backing it since miners ultimately mine the most profitable chain. A hard fork like BIP102 however is never convergent.",

Not even Core is working on it.  \r\n  \r\nHowever it seems like the ginny is out of the bottle, the disruption is unavoidable, it's hard to tell how big it will be.  \r\nI was wondering if having a temporary (and already unavoidable) UASF disruption is a bigger risk, than crippling the Bitcoin development and the scaling of Bitcoin?  \r\n  \r\nWhile the answer to that question can be vague, but more importantly we should decide **when does not merging UASF by default becomes a bigger systemic risk than merging it?**  ",

Thus I would think it would be better if there was a general means of signalling support for bips (including segwit) rather then just the odd implementation for one off cases such as this. So I would think that your code should be made generic in parts to support a range of signalling for BIPS. \r\n\r\nI also think that as there is a 'start date' for this, there should also be an 'end date' so that if it fails it is not active in the codebase forever.

BIP 148 nodes will disconnect from (and ban IIRC) non-BIP 148 nodes after they relay a number of bip148-invalid blocks. non-BIP 148 nodes will still be able to connect to other non-BIP 148 nodes and maintain a separate non-BIP148 blockchain. Node's won't be crashing or doing anything that would \"bring down the network\".\r\n\r\nThere would be risk for transaction replay and for blockchain reorganizations. The miners are incentivised to use BIP 148 the BIP 148 chain will not be able to be wiped out by the non-BIP 148 chain. However the opposite of that is true; the non-BIP 148 chain could be wiped out by the BIP 148 chain if it were to be longer than it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, you should read the \"petty document\" since it does explain a lot of this stuff.",

That's a sunken cost fallacy.  Not insignificant chunks of the miners, users, and economic actors seem to be opposed it.  Their reasons and motivation is not relevant.  All that matters is that segwit does not have near-universal acceptance, which has always been the standard for upgrading the protocol.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to merge in options that allow users to break off onto a different chain under not-unlikely scenarios, why not also add in non-segwit base blocksize increases as options too?

This project has always held high standards for deploying consensus-changing proposals while minimizing risks to consensus splits.  In my view, BIP 148 as drafted is incompatible with the goals of this project, and putting it behind a command line option does not address the fundamental nature of this incompatibility.  (I'll refrain from posting further on BIP 148 as I agree that GitHub is not the best place for these discussions but as this is my primary objection to this PR I see no other choice but to make some mention of it here.

Failing to protect users and miners by providing an *option* that puts them on the side of the fork that's less likely to encounter a reorg seems irresponsible.   \r\n\r\nIf the current trend continues, and we try to roll something out as a last minute reaction - it could be too late to protect our most important users.   Having it as an option allows users to enable it if needed to side with whatever the majority may be.   If it comes to that, we can enable it by default, and make an announcement that people should either recompile or enable the option.  Or the reverse:  remove it from the code base and announce it will no longer be supported.",

Otherwise the network could become partitioned on Aug 1st.\r\n\r\n@maaku This is no different from any other softfork. Unlike Segwit, there isn't a stripped block to be avoided. Perhaps some mechanism like this could be an improvement, but it probably isn't necessary, and can't be secure against sybil attacks anyway.\r\n\r\n@RHavar BIP148 is indeed truly the lower-risk option.\r\n\r\n> While the answer to that question can be vague, but more importantly we should decide when does not merging UASF by default becomes a bigger systemic risk than merging it?\r\n\r\n@nopara73 It is *already* a bigger risk to not merge BIP148, than to merge it.\r\n\r\n> This can be implemented on top of -blocknotify and RPC invalidateblock, and useragent change without this dangerous modification. Any volunteer to contribute this solution?\r\n\r\n@paveljanik Why should Core require an external script/program to remain a fully validating node?\r\n\r\n> Correct me if I'm wrong, but in case of long coexistance of two chains, and then BIP148 chain overpowering the old one, wouldn't it cause very long reorg?\r\n\r\n@mcgravier Only for non-full nodes (ie, failing to enforce BIP148). This is always and already a risk if miners create long invalid blockchains, it isn't a new thing introduced by BIP148 specifically. It is normal in a softfork that old nodes have this risk.\r\n\r\n> @jameshilliard back to the code. This change allows for an 'eclipse' style attack as you have suggested. As such it does have to do with node counts. \r\n\r\n@AllanDoensen What are you talking about? The code doesn't do anything you describe. Why do you pretend to read the code, when what you're saying has nothing to do with what the code actually does??\r\n\r\n> BIP 148 carries high, unnecessary risk of a chain split, as has been discussed on the mailing list.\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar As with any softfork, miners who create long invalid blockchains violating the rules can cause a chain split. Such a chain split is not caused by BIP 148, but by non-compliant miners creating invalid blocks. Furthermore, this risk is strictly *reduced* by increased adoption of the softfork, since it becomes less economically viable for miners to go on producing these invalid blocks very long.\r\n\r\n@earonesty This PR should be closed and rebased against master.",

      "body" : "> @earonesty: Failing to protect users and miners by providing an option that puts them on the side of the fork that's less likely to encounter a reorg seems irresponsible. If the current trend continues, and we try to roll something out as a last minute reaction - it could be too late to protect our most important users. \r\n\r\n> @luke-jr : It is already a bigger risk to not merge BIP148, than to merge it.\r\n\r\nThis kind of argument is weak I'm amazed it's been repeated so many times.\r\n\r\nThe simple _existence_ of a soft fork patch that has the potential to wipe out the legacy chain does not warrant the inclusion of that patch in the official Core software, which must **maintain a high standard** for changes, as @sdaftuar and others have pointed out.\r\n\r\nIf say, BU releases a similar soft fork patch that also endangers the legacy chain in the event that they get 51% hash rate (in fact, they would be in a better position to do so), would you guys be OK with including that software patch into the Core client? No.\r\n\r\nYou know who else used similar logic / scare tactic to justify their action? the people that caused the Cold War nuclear arms race. \r\n\"If you don't improve our nuclear capability -> the Russians might nuke us first.\"\r\n\"If you don't include this patch in Core client -> the network might blow up.\"\r\n\r\nTL;DR: This is the wrong sort of argument to be used for including changes in Core.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
