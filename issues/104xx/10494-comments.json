      "body" : "Responding to the above points,\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli Personally I would prefer that it remain open here for a while, to allow more people to comment.  \r\n\r\nA long while ago I made an active decision not to further participate in bitcoin-dev mailing list.  I do not participate in (publish to or comment upon) items in bitcoin-dev or bitcoin-core-dev.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to the idea of this issue being moved to bitcoin-core-dev mailing list, but at that point I would no longer be a participant in the discussion.  While it is active on github, I would be able to make comments here and at some point contribute.  \r\n\r\nIf you do move it to bitcoin-core-dev etc., please provide a link to this issue or simply copy the text of the issue description so as to include the originally provided material including proposed definition and reasonings I have originally submitted.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question of if the ecosystem and not only Core is involved, my sense is that this is really an issue for Core development.  But, as I suggest in the Conclusion of the issue, fungibility in Bitcoin in fact may be improved by just such an effort, \"particularly with the evolution and trajectory of developments such as Segwit and Lightning.\"  So there would potentially be indirect effects that would be positive for fungibility.\r\n\r\n@laanwj I would like to contribute some code for this purpose (would like to be a contributor on something related to this issue), but my own assessment of it is that it would most likely be viable for Core \"down the road\" as I have suggested, when not only Segwit but as well Lightning have been incorporated, primarily for the reasons of the features of Lightning / lnd, including of course \"payments (being) routed across more than one blockchain (including altcoins)\" and \"onion-style routing.\"  \r\n\r\nA brief note about your comment on the length of the write-up.  Had I simply provided a short write-up and not specified really any reasons why I was suggesting this, I would have been subjected to criticism that there was no reason being provided for why this should even be considered at all.    The longer write-up made sense in this context.  I would also point out that there are various other issues with lengthy write-ups, for which there is good reason for doing so.  One example is the issue titled \"Improve transaction privacy / fungibility in Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin system [meta tracking issues],\" https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6568 authored by @gmaxwell which I have linked to as part of this issue description for reasons of discussion relating to fungibility.  Note that there have been no pull requests in that issue but there has been productive discussion, some of which could eventually lead to a pull request.\r\n\r\nIt is my intent to continue to encourage productive and respectful discussion on this issue so long as it is open.
