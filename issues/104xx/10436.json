   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\nRequests are kept waiting even after clients disconnect. The queue can go full, blocking further json-rpc calls. Usually not a problem, except when long polling. Long polling getblocktemplate will hold a slot until another block has been received. \r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n1. Long poll getblocktemplate\r\n2. Disconnect\r\n3. Repeat 1+2 until requests fail\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nWorking json-rpc.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: throw away requests from disconnected clients. Maybe reserve some slots for quick (non long polling) requests so long polling requests can't as easily lock up json-rpc.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nAfter the long polling client reconnects a few times, there is the following error:\r\n\r\nWARNING: request rejected because http work queue depth exceeded, it can be increased with the -rpcworkqueue= setting\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.14.1\r\n",
