This is currently not possible.\r\n\r\nOnce you initially start Bitcoin-Core, it does download the complete blockchain ~100GB and verifies (almost) all transactions. This takes time... and can take up to serval days.\r\n\r\nYou can enable pruning (auto-cut off old blocks) with starting with `-prune=550` (or add `prune=550` to the `bitcoin.conf`). This will reduce the disk space to ~3-4GB (instead of 100GB+).\r\n\r\nRunning just the wallet is not possible.",
