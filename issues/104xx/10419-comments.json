Why not [merge the open pull requests instead](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/github-merge.py), catch the typos/incorrect includes etc etc and then advise changes in the PRs while they are still open?",

These cover the spectra from identifying trivial typos to running and triaging output from `clang-tidy` and similar tools. However, the cleanup work is all manual. See [my gardening efforts in the Apple Swift project for examples of issues covered by my gardening toolkit](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Apracticalswift).\r\n\r\nFor various reasons the Swift project is a bit more strict (i.e. near zero tolerance towards `clang-tidy` violations, full PEP-8 compliance, etc.), so I'm using a more relaxed subset of the same toolkit when gardening the Bitcoin project :-)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the toolkit work flow does not yet support checking not-yet-merged pull requests easily, but that is something I would like to add in the future :-)",
