      "body" : "@RHavar You seem to be reporting a few different issues here, so let me know if I don't cover your concerns.\r\n\r\nDefinitely transactions being evicted from the mempool will not cause the estimator to think they were confirmed.  In fact it's an improvement in the new code that they will now count as a failure for any confirmation targets smaller than the number of blocks for which they were outstanding.\r\n\r\nWhat I think you are seeing is that estimatesmartfee 1008 would actually return something less than the mempool min fee so in that event it always returns the mempool min fee.  (this is why estimaterawfee is retuning a lower number)\r\n\r\nThe long term estimates are definitely a bit more experimental, and if the mempool isn't big enough for many transactions to stick around for 1008 blocks, this will make it difficult to return reasonable estimates for that time frame.  I'm not really sure of an easy solution to make it much better.\r\n\r\nAs for the concern about short term estimates being more responsive.  It's expected that it'll take several hours to respond to a drop in market prices.  This is much more responsive than the prior code.  However what I think happened on June 3rd is that just before the drop there was a spike, so the old code didn't respond to the spike and hence temporarily returned slightly lower estimates than the new code, but several hours after the time you reported, I imagine you would have found the new estimates much lower than the old (I can see the new estimates continued to drop but I don't have the old estimates handy).\r\n",

Although:\r\n\r\n> What I think you are seeing is that estimatesmartfee 1008 would actually return something less than the mempool min fee so in that event it always returns the mempool min fee.\r\n\r\nIs the part I'm struggling with. Anecdotally I have dozens of transactions that are paying 25 sat/byte (that I've been continually rebroadcasting for weeks) that aren't getting confirmed. So it seems a bit strange to me that the fee estimate thinks that 10.7 sat/byte is sufficient. \r\n\r\nI guess one possibility is my transactions are not getting confirmed because they're a bit big (e.g.\r\ncdc70781c95fefc5599aa723d630fdb151c56576b64f6f94dac485d94e28fbbd ) when miners might not have enough space in the end of their block for low fee paying transaction.  I can experiment with creating some smaller sized transactions",

I'm just using a smaller mempool as it gets a bit too slow for me the dump it for analysis when it's larger. If any thing though, I would've assumed that having a smaller mempool would cause the fee estimate to be more aggressive (since transactions get rejected that otherwise might confirm).
