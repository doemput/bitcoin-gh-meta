   "body" : "There have been a few PRs lately that have failed checks due to a bug introduced in #10287. The first check happened to work already because the chosen addresses didn't collide. The ```addrman.Clear()``` after that check causes addrman's salt to be reset, making all future tests non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nWhen inserting two addresses of the same class, from the same source, there's a 1/64 chance that their hashes will collide. So it's faulty logic to be checking for an exact size. @sipa, mind verifying that?\r\n\r\nI'd like to fix this properly by ensuring determinism in the test as a next step, but I'd rather fix the spurious failures asap.",
