The only way a UASF goes forward is if you idiots merge it into Core and promote it. What about the 50%+ support from miners for Emergent Consensus or at least some larger block size. This doesn't seem to get any weight around here but then some idiots on reddit are running nodes with BIP148 and all of the sudden we have to follow them because 'consensus'.",

All early softforks in Bitcoin were user activated, and I think it's a perfectly fine way of getting new features.\r\n\r\n> its a softfork, it cant split the chain as both versions are compatible.\r\n\r\nSorry, that's nonsense. Soft forks are safe if a majority of the hashrate enforces the new rules. Segwit itself (BIP141) is designed to have very little risks of forking even if that's not the case. BIP 148 is not, and *will* fork users off who are not aware of the risks they are taking.\r\n",

Finally, with sufficient support to compel 50+% of miners (via financial incentives), BIP148 can avoid *any* chain split whatsoever.
