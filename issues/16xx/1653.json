It would be additionally useful to have a key both frozen and neutered, so that it's effectively watch only and the data isn't even in the wallet.\n\nThis can be used to avoid contamination from commingled inputs, to set aside special inputs that are to be used in contracts, or to create watching only wallets for improved security.",
