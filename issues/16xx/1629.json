   "body" : "When bitcoin-qt's \"over the size limit\" warning is triggered and an additional transaction fee is suggested, the client currently gives the options of \"continue\" or \"cancel\". This is problematic because, as I understand it, the bitcoin network does not truly mandate fees, particularly not in the amount shown (which is sometimes egregious), and a user could continue to submit the transaction and wait for a miner to process without the additional suggested fee.\n\nThe dialog should be modified to allow the user to send the coins without forcing attachment of bitcoin-qt's suggested fee.\n\nSee https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=11613.0 for more discussion on this (at this point, thread is over a year old).",
