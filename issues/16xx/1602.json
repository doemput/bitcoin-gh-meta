First of all my BTC went unconfirmed, then my confirmations went *negative*, on the bottom of the client it says \"WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct! You may need to upgrade, or the other nodes need to upgrade.\" and finally it tries to download blocks which I had downloaded in the past, the 171192th block generated 123 ago and it doesn't seem to make any progress.\n\nI downloaded the client again and replaced the existing one, but nothing changed. :O\n\nScreenshot: http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/1336/screenshot20120717at012.png\nVersion: 0.6.3-beta",
