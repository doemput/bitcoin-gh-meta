It can be fooled by a fake subtree merge commit, but that would hopefully be obvious to reviewers.\r\n* Make Travis invoke this subtree check for each of our subtrees.\r\n\r\nNote that Travis is currently expected to fail on this PR, as 2 out of 4 subtrees (`src/secp156k1` and `src/univalue` have been modified directly in master).",
