   "body" : "Alternative to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11208, closes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11207\r\n\r\nAccording to the [Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qwidget.html#restoreGeometry), restoreGeometry does all the checks we need, so it would be better to rely on them instead of doing it ourselves.\r\n\r\n~Haven't tested this properly yet, hence the WIP.~ \r\nGives expected behavior exactly as the other system apps do based on my tests. Only potential issue is the case when the GUI is almost entirely offscreen with only a single strip of pixels, its not really possible to see the GUI, but if you know it's there you can bring it back onscreen with just the mouse. And that's exactly how notepad behaves on Windows so I don't think its a real issue.\r\n\r\nThis also gives much better behavior when closing a maximized window, currently (0.15.0 release) a maximized window will save the window size on close, and then reopen as a not-maximized but still that size, which is really annoying. This reopens as maximized.\r\n\r\nGitian build here: https://bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch/build/305",
