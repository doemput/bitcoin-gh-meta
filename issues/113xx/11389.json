   "body" : "Most tests shouldn't have to deal with the now-historical SegWit activation transition (and other deployments, but SegWit is certainly the hardest one to accomodate).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes a versionbits starttime of -1 equal to \"always active\", and enables it by default for SegWit on regtest. Individual tests can override this by using the existing `-vbparams` option.\r\n\r\nA few unit tests and functional tests are adapted to indeed override vbparams, as they specifically test the transition.\r\n\r\nThis is in preparation for wallet SegWit support, but I thought having earlier eyes on it would be useful.",
