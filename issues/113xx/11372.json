They are not intended for backporting.\r\n\r\nThis removes the `CBase58`, `CBitcoinSecret`, `CBitcoinExtKey`, and `CBitcoinExtPubKey` classes, in favor of simple `Encode`/`Decode` functions. Furthermore, all Bitcoin-specific logic (addresses, WIF, BIP32) is moved to `key_io.{h,cpp}`, leaving `base58.{h,cpp}` as a pure utility that implements the base58 encoding/decoding logic.",
