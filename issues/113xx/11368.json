   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\nbitcoin-core crashes after too many rpc calls done.\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n1. listen on zeromq 'rawtx' event.\r\n2. make an rpc request (getrawtransaction) for every transactions input\r\n3. wait a while\r\n4. when a new block comes bitcoin-core crashes with database IO failure. \r\n\r\nIncreasing the rpcqueue in config does not solve the issue, but delays crash\r\nWhen bitcoin-core's nofiles limit (increased with prlimit) got increased to 8192 it seems to be stable, but maybe it is just a function of time to make it crash.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nI would expect I get a queue full error (as I get), but core will not crash, just my requests will time out\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\ncore crashes with IO database error when a new block arrives. When checking fd's for bitcoin it is normaly aroun 300, after a while it spikes to more than 1000 and bitcoind crashes. If the rpc gets queried while bitcoind is starting and is not in sync, or a new block arrives it crashes almost immediately.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nhappened on 0.14.2, 0.15.0.rc3, 0.15.0, 0.15.0.1 - did not test others\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\ntrid on 2 computers a laptop and armhf based odroid xu4 , runing linux. Happened on both. \r\n\r\n",
