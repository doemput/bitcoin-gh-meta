This means:\r\n   - Conflict resolution is cleaner in case a file of the same name exists both in the core folder and in the same folder as the including file - previously, to include the core file one had to either use a relative include path (../) or a brackets-system include. Now the core/ prefix can be used for cleaner disambiguation.\r\n   - Files from the same folder can be included with no prefix with clear semantics, since files with no prefix are no longer maybe from the root src folder.",
