   "body" : "Make the non-const overload of `CBlockIndex::GetAncestor()` reuse the const overload implementation instead of the other way around. This way, the constness of the const overload implementation is guaranteed. The other way around, it was possible to implement the non-const overload in a way which mutates the object, and since that implementation would be called even for const objects (due to the reuse), we would get undefined behavior.",
