   "body" : "The `gitian-build.sh` script crashes with an error when I tried to use it, @kallewoof also had this same issue:\r\n\r\n\tlxcbr0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device\r\n\tSIOCSIFADDR: No such device\r\n\tlxcbr0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device\r\n\r\nAnd then:\r\n\r\n\tlxc-execute: failed to find gateway addresses\r\n\tlxc-execute: failed to spawn 'gitian'\r\n\t./bin/gbuild:21:in `system!': failed to run make-clean-vm --suite trusty --arch amd64 (RuntimeError)\r\n\r\nI believe it's because of the two lines which this PR removes, I tested it and seems to work as expected now. These lines are unique to this script and aren't mentioned in `gitian-building.md` or `release-process.md`. We discussed it on IRC, @achow101 agrees removing these lines would probably fix it: https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/2017-09-19/?msg=91299782&page=2\r\n\r\nHas anyone successfully used this script as-is? Or does everyone else manually run the builds/write their own script like I have up til this point?",
