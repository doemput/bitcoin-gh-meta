This then results in `validateaddress` return ISMINE_NO because it does not have a wallet to use. This may actually be an issue with some other RPC calls that are not dedicated wallet RPCs (e.g. signrawtransaction).\r\n\r\n#10583 should fix this problem as it makes a dedicated RPC call for the wallet stuff of validateaddress.",
