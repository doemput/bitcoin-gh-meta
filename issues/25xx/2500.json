I check if I own that account:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser@computer:~/dev/bitcoin/src$ ./bitcoind getaddressesbyaccount \"\"\r\n[\r\n    \"12xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\r\n]\r\nuser@computer:~/dev/bitcoin/src$ ./bitcoind getaddressesbyaccount wallet\r\n[\r\n    \"1Gxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\r\n    \"13xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't known the account and freak out and almost post on a forum asking for help figuring out what happened. Then I suspect that my bitcoin client still knows where the money is since it's showing a balance of 12.00000000.\r\n\r\nThen I attempt to send the full 12.00000000 to another account and succeed.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug? Where is the private key for 1Fxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx? Why was anything sent to 1Fxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx? I read that bticoind pre-generates addresses and puts them in a queue. If this is the next account that was pre-generated, why wasn't it added to any account? This really looks like a bug to me. Can I check what addresses are currently pre-generated or something like that?\r\n\r\nCan someone help me figure out what happened?",
