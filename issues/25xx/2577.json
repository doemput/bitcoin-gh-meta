   "body" : "This is a quick, safe fix for transaction fee handling. A riskier, more complicated fix still needs to happen, but will take more time to code/test/etc.\r\n\r\nTwo motivations for this pull:\r\n\r\nFirst, to discourage people from bloating users' wallets and the UTXO set with tiny outputs.\r\n\r\nThis pull defines 'uneconomic dust' as 54.3 uBTC (5430 satoshis, about $0.007 at current prices), and treats any transaction with outputs less than 5430 satoshis as non-standard (won't be relayed, won't be mined). 5430 satoshis is derived from the cost (in fees) to spend a TxOut/TxIn.  See https://people.xiph.org/~greg/txouts2.png  for proportion of recent outputs this will (eventually) affect.\r\n\r\nSecond, we have no idea what will happen to Bitcoin prices or transaction volume / competition for space in blocks. So this patch lets users and miners specify the minimum transaction fees at startup, using the -mintxfee / -mintxrelayfee options (which I'm intentionally leaving undocumented for now). The dust/nonstandard test is based on the -mintxrelayfee.\r\n\r\nQt and RPC both now tell the user why CreateTransaction fails, if it fails; Qt error reporting is a little wonky (try to send one satoshi, and you get two modal dialog boxes, one after the other; I don't care enough to try to fix that).\r\n\r\nNote: I spent several hours trying, and failing, to create unit tests for this patch; CWallet::fFileBacked is ignored by several of the wallet routines used by CWallet::CreateNewTransaction. In the end, I decided thatrefactoring CWallet to support unit testing would be much more extensive and riskier than these changes.\r\n",
