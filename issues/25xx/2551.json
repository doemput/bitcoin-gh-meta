   "body" : "Once in a while there is someone with a unexplained crash in bitcoin-qt/bitcoind. This seems to happen especially on MacOSX and Windows.\r\n\r\nMost we can do right now is ask for the debug.log, but most of the time it doesn't help a lot. The OS-specific crashlogs that people send contain raw addresses, or at most function+offset. I'd like to improve the diagnosis ability. We can't just ask people \"to run it in gdb\" anymore. I'd like to get as much as possible information without having to ask the user to do anything.\r\n\r\nThings I've considered\r\n\r\n1) I don't think proposing something such as Google Breakpad would fly here, due to the obvious private key leak risk. It would in principle be possible to build something that just uploads a stack trace and debug.log and not any private key data. That would be very useful instead of asking for people to paste/upload the debug.log and stacktraces.\r\n\r\n2) Including the debug information would increase the executable size enormously. However it would be possible to change the Gitian build (and Mac build) to store the debug information before stripping it off; this would allow us to at least resolve stack traces and such with main.o+0x2398 to a a line number at our side. \r\n",
