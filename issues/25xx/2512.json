If you try this without the restart, you'll get this: \"TX rejected (code -22)\"\r\nIf a transaction is already in the client's memory, it should return a more specific error message, the way \"transaction already in block chain (code -5)\" is returned for one of those transactions. In addition, there should be a way to force a rebroadcast, whether that's simply making a would-be rebroadcast go through rather than rejecting, or adding a command that will push it through anyway.",
