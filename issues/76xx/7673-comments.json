I tend to agree wholly with your message, it is the long game that counts, let's focus on the challenges ahead, instead of certain toxic personalities and short term Pyrrhic struggles.\r\n\r\nYes, you certainly had some difficulty posting this, sorry for that. @Btcdrak is not to blame for this, we have to be extremely strict with moderation. Due to previous waves of trolling, sockpuppeting, in every discussion venue that has remotely to do with bitcoin, we have to make sure that channels such as this stick to technical discussion only. Not because your message is at fault, but it could potentially trigger an avalanche of non-constructive, even abusive replies, wasting everyone's time. No, I don't like that either, but that's what the community made it into...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nWladimir\r\n",
