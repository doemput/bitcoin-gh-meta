My thoughts were that the code should run coin selection twice. Once for a transaction with no change output (trying to minimize for the extraneous mining fee), and once for a transaction with a change output. \r\n\r\nThen you can compare the mining fee of the two transactions (but applying a X penalty to the one with a change output)  and pick the one with a smaller mining fee. \r\n\r\n\r\n(I think X will be around ~50 bits, but you can more scientifically calculate it by figuring out the extra fee increase transaction by increase a transaction size of +1 output and +1 transaction input)",

It also means that the average value of utxo in your wallet would strictly increase. If extra inputs aren't added, we would expect the average value of UTXO in your wallet to decrease over time.  Low value UTXO are not as likely to be selected in the future, because the selection algorithm generally tries to minimize the number of inputs used.",

If it's just #7664  it would means that I'm paying the fees later instead of right away, which isn't so terrible. The real problem is that it's generating so many outputs of 0.01 BTC, which is totally useless. Having a lot of dust outputs would in fact be more useful (e.g. for when i need to send dust, a common case :P) \r\n\r\nAlso, is it just my imagination or does 0.11 have better estimatefee logic too? I've never once on bitcoin 0.12  see  `bitcoin-cli estimatefee 1` return anything but -1, and it seems to give significantly more expensive estimates than before. ",
