      "body" : "> Aren't the same reasons for not removing the alerts then still applicable today?\r\n\r\nJust read #6260 and the OP.\r\nA few months ago pretty much everyone was in favor of this, but there was no alternative notification system yet. There is now a mailing list for alerts instead.\r\n\r\nThe alert system suffers from many problems:\r\n \r\n- Philosophically, there should not be a key with special meaning on the P2P network, this has always been a sore point with other node implementations. Like the checkpoints, it is seen as a centralized point of control, thus should go. If there is to be a network-wide alert system, that would also need a network-wide bureaucracy for managing it.\r\n- The alert system is hardly tested and maintained. It opens an  attack surface to people possessing a certain private key, even though it is a fairly small one, there may be some bug in the alert system that would turn it into a full blown backdoor.\r\n- It is not clear what kind of emergencies qualify for using it (there was no agreement on using it to warn of the UPnP issue, even though it was a local network code execution exploit).\r\n- It's possible that this guy has or had access to it:\r\n```\r\n gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID EACB3C76, created 2010-07-22\r\n       \"Mark KarpelÃÂ¨s <mark@hell.ne.jp>\"\r\n```\r\n(and Satoshi, and possibly others who shouldn't really be able to)\r\n\r\nA notification mailing list doesn't have any of these problems - it will be about announcements and alerts about this specific software, and we can directly control who has post access.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm in no way against a 'better' alert system later on, such as one that doesn't rely on a special P2P message. There are some suggestions in #6260. But this one should go, and soon.\r\n",

Can we say, in the absence of the alert, how much longer it may take for such accidental hardfork to be quickly resolved?\r\n\r\nAlthough other public announcement methods can be used, node operators may not be paying attention at that specific point, with the alert probably being the most direct way of reaching them.\r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily against removing the alert, but I think there should first be some analysis of the effect its removal may have in times of emergencies. Would it, for example, mean that an accidental hardfork may go on for days rather than hours?\r\n\r\nIn regards to the suggestion that it is a centralised point, I do agree to an extent and individuals like MK for example should definitely not have the alert, but at the point of misuse the alert system can be revoked, thus achieving what is proposed. Until then, I am not sure what harm the alert system can do? A potential backdoor? Perhaps, but I don't see how and it sounds like high speculation with no basis. There \"could\" be a \"potential\" backdoor in every part of the code. \r\n\r\nEven assuming the Japanese police has this key, what damage can they do when any alert they may send would be instantly revoked?\r\n\r\nSo it's a NACK from me until full analysis of the effect of removing the alert would have on emergency situations.

With the current system, there is no communication across 'islands' of software with different keys.\r\n- Needs multiple developers to sign before sending a message - so that one leaked key isn't fatal, and one drunk (or forced) dev can't abuse the system\r\n- Needs to be transparently documented who owns which key, with the public keys hardcoded in the client, so that messages are attributable\r\n- Needs a way to safely rotate keys in a scheduled way, so that the same keys don't stay in use for years\r\n\r\nAs said (now for the third time) I'd be happy to see an implementation of a better alert system, some have been discussed in #6260.

I feel like this is simply a waste of time and meant to only boot folks with said keys out of the system and overall serves no real purpose. If you can cite why this will be beneficial for Bitcoin, I might be more likely to ACK. But this serves no purpose other than removing people from the system. This is a trivial thing, but a decentralized messaging layer should stay intact as is now. 3 people have the keys and it is overall not affecting anything. Engineering power should be put towards more urgent matters.",

At least as long as the automated tests don't cover everything on every scenario on every platform (and some things, like people that act in unpredictable ways, can hardly be covered by automated tests).\r\n\r\nI do agree that you could structure an open source project that way. We're hampered also by the monolithic structure of the code. E.g. if the alert system was an external plugin, people who care about it could still maintain it, and we'd only have to make sure that our side of the API does what is advertised. But for better or worse, we have this bottleneck.\r\n\r\n>  it makes bitcoin core a rather uninteresting project to the wider community.\r\n\r\nPossibly. But on the other hand, what we do support we try to keep working as well as possible. It's a bit of a compromise, where on one side you have a heap of barely-third-party-maintained hacks and on the other side you have a cathedral. I try to keep to a sensible middle, as said above, as far as the code structure allows.\r\n",
