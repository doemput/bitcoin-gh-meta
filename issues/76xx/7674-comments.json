The workaround is building QT with DirectWrite disabled (as in QT 5.5), i.e. build QT with -no-directwrite flag.\r\n\r\nIndeed, bitcoin-qt.exe of Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 is linked with QT 5.5.0 and it works properly on Windows XP SP3 32bit.\r\n\r\nBesides the workaround there is a real fix in the QT code. Take a look at their already fixed QTBUG-50188 bug report:\r\nhttps://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-50188\r\nand the commit itself:\r\nhttps://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/144954/\r\n\r\nI don't know which QT version is used in Bitcoin Core 0.12.x but updating it to the latest or making a custom QT build with -no-directwrite flag should fix the bitcoin-qt.exe crashes on Windows XP.\r\n\r\nPlease use one of the above solutions.

      "body" : "@tzofeolam Interesting, thanks for figuring that out!\r\nBut unfortunately, Bitcoin Core 0.12 is also linked against Qt 5.5.0. The MinGW version did change, so it is possible that that automatically toggled `-directwrite` behavior.\r\n\r\nBumping Qt on master has to happen before the 0.13 release (and if it really fixes this issue it could be be backported to 0.12) but as the latest official release of Qt is 5.6.0, that could only make it worse in that regard.\r\n\r\nIn any case it'd be useful to experiment with that.\r\n",

Windows XP is no longer supported [as of 0.13](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.13/doc/release-notes.md):\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n==============\r\n\r\nMicrosoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),\r\nan OS initially released in 2001. This means that not even critical security\r\nupdates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin\r\nwallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core\r\nrandomly crashing on Windows XP. It is [not clear](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7681#issuecomment-217439891)\r\nwhat the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream\r\nlibraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.\r\n\r\nWe do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is\r\nend-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are\r\nsuggested to upgrade to a newer verion of Windows, or install an alternative OS\r\nthat is supported.\r\n\r\nNo attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,\r\nyou can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not\r\nreport issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\r\n",
