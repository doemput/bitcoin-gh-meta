I was wondering why every time I restarted bitcoind I had to manually use the RPC `settxfee` command again. That's just user error on my part, but the similarity of the config setting and the RPC command names probably contributed.",

This was already in 0.10.\r\n- ed3e5e468c5b7973d71efe51c90c3a301d570e27 #5200: Added an option `fPayAtLeastCustomFee` which has, for <1kB transactions, the effect of rounding up. This was also in 0.10.\r\n- a7751824ce8a7e1cc5511794516fe674bc3eaa3c #7103: Default fPayAtLeastCustomFee to false. This made it into 0.12.\r\n\r\nSo all in all, rounding was already disabled in 0.10. It makes sense for this not to be mentioned in the release notes for 0.12. However what seems to have changed multiple times is the behavior for small transactions, due to fPayAtLeastCustomFee. This should have been mentioned.\r\n\r\n> I tried to do exactly this in the release notes. Unfortunately I did not receive any feedback on the content, but I am happy to extend this. Maybe the website is a better place to curate such documentation?\r\n\r\nI don't really mind where, could just be some file in `doc/` but having a document about the fee computation, anywhere, would be great.",
