   "body" : "This PR replaces the hardcoded string \"bitcoin\" in the NSIS script with the autoconf variable PACKAGE_TARNAME; fixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7265 .\r\n\r\nPlaces where I chose not to replace:\r\n\r\n1. bitcoin.ico wasn't replaced because it doesn't seem to be relevant to the build system and its filename never affects the end user.\r\n2. InstallDir wasn't replaced because the current text has an uppercase B, and I'm not sure of a good way to capitalize the result of PACKAGE_TARNAME.\r\n3. A comment in the Main Installer section wasn't replaced because comments don't ever face the end user.\r\n4. The registry value \"URL:Bitcoin\" wasn't replaced for the same reason as InstallDir.\r\n5. Startup shortcut wasn't replaced for the same reason as InstallDir.\r\n\r\nAll other appearances of \"bitcoin\" in the NSIS script were replaced.",
