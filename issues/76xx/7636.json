   "body" : "This is a change for the QT wallet\r\n\r\n**Why this change?**\r\nThis way the user can be sure that the QR code scanner app he/she's using is not displaying a different address to maliciously steal the funds.\r\n\r\nI've seen an android app in the wild that is a simple qr code scanner but when it scans a bitcoin address it replaces it with a different address belonging to the hacker. I'm starting to get worried of bitcoin address qr codes without a label that states the address in clear so that the user can always check that he/she is depositing the funds to the desired address. \r\nThat's why I decided to modify the bitcoin qt code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Code changes:**\r\n\r\n- renamed myImage to qrImage\r\n- added qrAddrImage in which the bitcoin address label is painted onto\r\n- scaled the saved pixmap with antialiasing to improve readability of the text and the scanning of the qrcode\r\n",
