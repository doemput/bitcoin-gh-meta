Something like https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/dc1b96d368d471ea5242ca021148f9f900f69661 or #5114 but maybe not based on #6068, since #6068 seems extremely hard for reasons I still don't understand. I guess I just leave it there in case someone wants to rebase or rewrite such a thing. Sorry, I cannot help remembering every time I review changes in amount.o.\r\n",
