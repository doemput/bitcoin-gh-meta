      "body" : "@laanwj Yes, agreed that flexibility is important here.  However, is there a loss in flexibility if a forked project has to change \"$PACKAGE_TARNAME\" to something else in the four binary name variables, rather than changing \"bitcoin\" to something else in the same variables?  I'm definitely not arguing that those four variables should be removed, I just think it makes sense for their default values to be dependent on PACKAGE_TARNAME since that seems to be a common configuration.  Any forked project that wants the binary filename prefixes to be something other than PACKAGE_TARNAME can change them just as easily as changing them away from being \"bitcoin\".  So I don't see a loss of flexibility -- am I missing something?",
