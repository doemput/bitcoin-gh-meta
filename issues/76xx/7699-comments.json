      "body" : "I don't think you can compare paying fees to having a steak vs. salad. It is more like everyone gives the waiter two bucks (a fixed amount) because they were all served alike.\r\n\r\nThe fee is not a value relative to the value you send. I.e. you don't have to pay more fee because you send more. You can see it as a fixed value for every transaction you make, where the fee pays for the \"footprint\" of your transaction on the network.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes sense to have someone pay more when sending a larger amount as everyone receives the same service from the network.",
