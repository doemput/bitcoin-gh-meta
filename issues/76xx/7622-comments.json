At that time, miners hadn't yet decided to raise their block size cap, so action Bitcoin Core would take there would be preÃÂ«mptive. In contrast, this time round block sizes are regularly surpassing the 750kB limit, so now we're actually catching up with where the miners have already gone.",

As a side note, I do think that those who can demonstrate considerable investment in bitcoin should get more say on this than those who don't, so if a democratic aspect were to be invoked I would suggest it be one vote per bitcoin rather than one vote per person.",
