      "body" : "Good points, agreed on the concept. \r\n\r\nEspecially separating out (3) and making it self-contained is important, as the validation part is what makes Bitcoin, and having it as a library would encourage diversity in clients. Other clients will want to have their own implementation of P2P network handling and the glue parts. \r\n\r\nRe: questions\r\n\r\n* Joining 1 and 2 makes sense. They could later be split if it becomes necessary, but planning forward too much for cases that aren't completely thought through is seldom constructive.\r\n\r\n* Seems safe to assume that that 4 (the glue) is always present if 1+2 are present. No matter how the other modules change, there will always be some glue needed to connect the P2P network to the validation engine.\r\n",
