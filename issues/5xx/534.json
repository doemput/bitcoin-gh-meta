   "body" : "The attack this prevents:  Generate valid low-difficulty blocks (maybe built on top of an early part of the block chain) and send them to a bitcoin node. Before this patch the bitcoin client could store an arbitrary number of them in memory or on disk, in case they later became part of the main chain.\r\n\r\nTwo checks are added:\r\n\r\n1) Blocks before the last blockchain lock-in are rejected, and the peer sending these obviously-not-part-of-the-main-chain blocks it will be disconnected and banned.\r\n\r\n2) Blocks must have a plausible proof-of-work. It is impossible for a difficulty 1.0 block to follow a difficulty 1-million block (it would take at least 19 months for difficulty to drop from 1-million to 1). Blocks with too-low proof-of-work are ignored, and peers relaying them are disconnected/banned.\r\n\r\nRequiring plausible proof-of-work for orphan blocks or alternate chains foils this attack (you would have to be able to generate valid blocks near current difficulty).\r\n \r\n",
