I can't force anyone to merge it, but I can at least make it easy for those who decide to tolerate it. Please keep in mind that it doesn't hurt the BTC-only URIs at all, and if nobody ends up using it for other units, it can always be removed later.\r\n        Best  case scenario: people use it and bitcoin-qt works correctly\r\n        Worst case scenario: people don't use it, and it can be removed\r\n\r\nFor 5 cBTC, use: amount=5x6\r\nFor 5 mBTC, use: amount=5x5\r\nFor 5 ÃÂ¼BTC, use: amount=5x2\r\nFor 5 Satoshis, use: amount=5x0",
