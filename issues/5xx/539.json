   "body" : "Some important (and less important) updates for the Qt UI\r\n\r\nCore:\r\n\r\n* use median filter (`CMedianFilter`) for peer-reported reported number of blocks\r\n    * this fixes problem that one misconfigured or malicious node can mess up progress bar\r\n    * implementation in `src/util.h`\r\n    * testcase in `src/test/util_tests.cpp`\r\n\r\nUI:\r\n\r\n* Translation handling\r\n    * Include translations as resource, so that they are included in the executable. This saves a lot of hassle on installation (less files to worry about), and is similar to how other Qt applications do it\r\n    * In resources, use `nl_NL` format instead of `nl`, so that the correct translation is chosen based on system locale automatically\r\n* Improve send coins screen\r\n    * Add balance to remind users how much they can send\r\n    * No longer clear input when switching tabs; this is non-intuitive and can cause loss of work. Instead, add a \"clear input\" button.\r\n\r\nBuild system (qmake):\r\n\r\n* Add `BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX` option to make it possible for distribution install scripts (such as Gentoo) to pass in alternative boost library version names without resorting to sed hacks\r\n* Factor out windows/mac specific include, lib paths so that they can be overridden (overall result is still the same)\r\n* Dependency library locations can be customized with `BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH`, `BOOST_LIB_PATH`, `BDB_INCLUDE_PATH`, `BDB_LIB_PATH`, `OPENSSL_INCLUDE_PATH` and `OPENSSL_LIB_PATH` respectively\r\n* Build translations (.qm) automatically in make, no need to run lrelease separately anymore\r\n\r\nMinor:\r\n\r\n* Add `Q_OBJECT` everywhere it should be according to Qt rules (removes warnings when lupdate parses sources)\r\n* Use `USE_DBUS` define instead of `QT_DBUS` to switch Linux notification mode, to prevent conflicts in some Qt versions\r\n* Update `OTHER_FILES` section in Qt creator so that all documentation is shown, now that both projects have been fully merged\r\n",
