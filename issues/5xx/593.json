   "body" : "This adds support for opening bitcoin-qt to handle a URL instead of just drag-and-drop URL support (which has been available in bitcoin-qt since before merge).\r\nAgain it does not support OSX as you have to add OSX-specific URL handling and I don't have access to any OSX boxes to code that.\r\nThis does add hooks to add Bitcoin as the default bitcoin: opener for Win32 in the nsis installer, also the bitcoin-qt packages in the bitcoin/bitcoin ppa on launchpad install gnome hooks for the same.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nIf bitcoin is already running, the launch of the second process will use boost/interprocess/ipc/message_queue to send the URL to the running process which will handle it.  Otherwise the new process will launch to the send coins window.\r\nBecause of this, if bitcoin crashes, links will have to be clicked 3 times before bitcoin will open.",
