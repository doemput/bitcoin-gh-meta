   "body" : "Added walletchangepass.py and walletunlock.py to contrib/wallettools.\r\n\r\nThese are two simple python scripts which send the appropriate RPC commands to unlock a wallet and change a wallet password. They are intended to prevent users from having to enter their password as a command-line argument which could then be stored in the console buffer/history in plaintext.\r\n\r\nBoth tools rely on bitcoin/bitcoind running with server=1 and an rpcuser and rpcpassword set in bitcoin.conf. They can be easily modified for non-standard ports. walletunlock.py unlocks the wallet for 60 seconds by default, changeable in code, and both modules rely upon python-json-rpc (http://json-rpc.org/wiki/python-json-rpc)\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Perry <enmaku@gmail.com>",
