This is the case on some OSes, making it unnecessary to have two binds.\r\n\r\nHave you tried connecting to the  port?\r\n",

Maybe it's worth noting this behavior in bitcoind help?\r\n\r\nBecause although the behavior has always been such, the option is unambiguously described that it binds to all interfaces by default:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -rpcbind=<addr>\r\n       Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. Use\r\n       [host]:port notation for IPv6. This option can be specified\r\n       multiple times (default: bind to all interfaces)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had to google some more time to find out an answer.",
