Rebroadcast of other transactions is unchanged and works as it always did.\r\n\r\nAbandoned and known-conflicted transactions are skipped.\r\n\r\nSome concern was expressed that there may be users with many\r\n unknown conflicts would waste a lot of CPU time trying to\r\n add them to their memory pools over and over again.  But I am\r\n doubtful these users exist in any number, if they do exist\r\n they have worse problems, and they can mitigate any performance\r\n issue this might have by abandoning the transactions in question.",
