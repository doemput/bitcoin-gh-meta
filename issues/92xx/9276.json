   "body" : " - first commit just roughly orders all of the RPC tests for running time and puts in comments so new tests can be added at approximately the right place.  i'm not sure its worth doing this very often.\r\n\r\n- second commit removes setting of `relaypriority=0` from the rpc tests.  it obviously wasn't necessary if they were passing after the `-limitfreerelay` change to default to 0.\r\n\r\n- third commit removes the obsolete file run-bitcoind-for-test.sh, but someone should check if I did this correctly, since now that I've removed it from .gitignore, everyones repos will complain that they have an extra file sitting around.  i wasn't sure how to clean that up?\r\n\r\nlet me know if only some of these commits are wanted and i get rid of the unwanted ones.",
