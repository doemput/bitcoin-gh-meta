   "body" : "This teaches Gitian to use the new depends system rather than the old build scripts. See #4592 for the reasoning.\r\n\r\nImportant: This relies on a new caching feature in Gitian. When building (for ex) the linux descriptor, the dependencies will be built and cached. On subsequent builds, if the dependencies have not changed, a cached version will be used rather than rebuilding. For that reason, the descriptors can be a clean one-per-OS. Gitian rev e9741525c or newer is required to take advantage of this.\r\n\r\nIn order to take advantage of the new cache, sources are no longer listed as inputs. Instead they are handled by the dependency builder. After they've been fetched once, they'll be cached and re-used.\r\n\r\nAll target libs are cross-built as necessary now, rather than using apt-get to install. That means that a single OS image (in this case Precise x64) can be used for everything.",
