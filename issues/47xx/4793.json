   "body" : "Continues #4506.\r\nFollowing @laanwj 's advice of only moving ScanHash, I found another solution to encapsulate the miner's pow without removing the miner's optimization, which was rejected in #4423 \r\nBut I would like to slightly change the behavior.\r\nCommit \"Replace proof.nNonce >= 0xffff000 with an iteration counter\" should be either rejected or squashed into \"proof.nNonce >= 0xffff0000 -> proof.OutOfRangeSolution()\" (and of course that 1000 in the for is open for bike-shedding).\r\n\"Small miner optimization\" also should be rejected or rebased in \"Remove testnet's special case from miner.cpp\".\r\nI think these 2 functional changes are meaningless enough that can be safely accepted.\r\nI would also be happy to just remove the hashmeter and the resulting PR would be simpler.",
