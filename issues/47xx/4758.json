   "body" : "Starting with 10.9, Framework versions must be signed individually, rather\r\nthan as a single bundle version, in order to be properly codesigned. This\r\nchange ensures that the proper plist files and symlinks are present prior to\r\npackaging.\r\n\r\nI believe I've tested this on all of my build scenarios, including the future static qt.\r\n\r\n@gavinandresen Please give this a real-world try (preferably by merging it into -rc1 locally and signing a gitian build there as though it were rc2) before ACKing. It worksforme (tm), but that means very little for Apple's tools.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that --deep will be needed for codesign until we switch to static libs.",
