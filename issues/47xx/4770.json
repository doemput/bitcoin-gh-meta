To make a giant response you need a giant output. So there might be some use case for doing a big query, at any rate, if the send buffer is too big then that's a general issue we should fix elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the end I didn't truncate the answer. I just return false which hits Misbehaving(). The reason is, again, no real app will ever hit this case. You need to deliberately pick a giant output and a giant number of repeated queries. So Misbehaving is a reasonable solution.",
