   "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am trying to install the bitcoin client on a Windows 10, following the build-windows.md file. \r\n\r\nThe latest version of automake (automake-1.15) seems incompatible with the client files. \r\n\r\nI tried linking automake-1.15 to automake-1.14 but am receiving the following error: \r\n\r\nconfigure.ac:32: error: version mismatch.  This is Automake 1.15,\r\nconfigure.ac:32: but the definition used by this AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE\r\nconfigure.ac:32: comes from Automake 1.14.1.  You should recreate\r\nconfigure.ac:32: aclocal.m4 with aclocal and run automake again.\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\nThanks,",
