   "body" : "If I create an RBF transaction using the Qt GUI but specify my own custom change address, bumpfee doesn't work because it claims it can't find the change address:\r\n\r\n    \"Transaction does not have a change output\"\r\n\r\nThis is because none of the outputs satisfy\r\n\r\n    pWallet->IsChange(...)\r\n\r\nI see there's a \"TODO\" commented in `CWallet::IsChange()` in `src/wallet/wallet.cpp`:\r\n\r\n    // TODO: fix handling of 'change' outputs. The assumption is that any\r\n    // payment to a script that is ours, but is not in the address book\r\n    // is change.\r\n\r\nI tend to put all my addresses in the address book whether I'm going to use them as change or not. I guess if the wallet was capable of creating its own SegWit change addresses I'd stop using custom change addresses, but currently it always seems to send change to a legacy address if I don't manually specify a change address.",
