If removing boost in general from the project is a goal, even for cases where there is no standard substitute, I suppose it should be listed under \"Projects\" as well.\r\n\r\nSecond, I think a reasonable compilation time increase is worth improving code clarity. Consider the \"endswith\" functionality here:\r\n- checking it inline instead of using a function requires a couple of if conditions, making it less readable and more error prone, which also means harder to review and less secure. One reading the code has only so much of an attention span, and it's bad to force details which are unnecessary in the context - implementing \"endswith\" inline is certainly out of the scope of the code where it is used.\r\n- Writing our own function is for the bitcoin repo in some utility header is fine, but it means a) using less tested code than the one boost uses and b) just more work which could be spent on more useful things.",
