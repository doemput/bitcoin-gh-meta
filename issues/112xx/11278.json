   "body" : "I've noticed a big uptick in the last couple weeks of transactions I believe are created for the purpose of tracking.\r\n\r\nA recent example is this:\r\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/ea4491d4335572e3b4aa37d5760dcc1aa718832442cd435c804c2609b12ba8ef\r\n\r\nSending 649 satoshis to my address. In this particular case it's a change-address of mine. I suspect the intention of the transaction is to find out information on  tracking service is interested in information about the transaction \"ae0d2736eacd78d97f8328cac4e4b9a8c7517b01c9df8c9a4628ac9cc21e25b9\" or \"d75534aff5b21aa279a6410594661bfd0ceb5711df005827f25ddd97510e25da\" and hoping I spend-link their dust.\r\n\r\nI believe there should be a comprehensive solution to prevent this \"forcible address reuse\" problem (and would be happy to throw a bitcoin or so to sponsoring its development) but a quick-fix to making this harder is for core to simply stop ever spending uneconomical outputs.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* Makes tracking significantly more expensive to do reliably (and thus stopping a lot of it)\r\n* Makes sure users don't lose money when sending\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n* Not great for bitcoins utxo :'(\r\n\r\n\r\n",
