One benefit of doing the scripted diff for all builds is to make it apparent from the build status overview that all builds fails. If only `arm-linux-gnueabihf` is red when a scripted diff fails it might look like a platform specific issue and hence require further investigation to see that it is a general scripted diff failure.\r\n\r\nThis argument could be raised for all checks that for performance reasons are specific to a given Travis build, but scripted diff should be fairly quick in the general case?",
