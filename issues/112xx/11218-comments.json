You would only really need 2 of the 3, and the other one can be calculated.\r\n\r\nPerhaps segwit transactions can have an extra key which is \"disksize\"... since non-segwit disksize == size, it can be removed.",

I'd prefer not to cache this in the mempool to avoid wasting memory, and I'm not sure it's worth reserializing the mempool contents to calculate this value whenever a user calls getrawmempool, because that rpc is already slow enough, and I don't know what the use case here would be...  Note that users can always calculate the serialized size themselves by asking for the serialized transaction directly, eg with getrawtransaction.",
