I believe this is related to #7869 and #11171. It seems that e9ff818b69c2f8ce4a151d1a81a3e22a4319c93d did not fix this problem.\r\n\r\nThis is easy to replicate; open regedit.exe (windows registry editor), find the registry keys in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt`. Edit the `nWindowPos` entry to be a point that is off screen. The next start of Bitcoin Core will result in the window being off screen and there is no way to get it back without doing `-resetguisettings`",
