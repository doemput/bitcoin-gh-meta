I'm submitting this as an RFC PR because I'd like to discuss a few aspects of it next week, and a PR makes it easier to point to.\r\n\r\nThese changes remove our old select() loop for socket handling in favor of libevent, which uses epoll/kqueue/etc. as a back-end. In addition to being faster and more efficient, this allows us to drop some annoying restrictions, namely that select can only handle 1024 sockets in practice on most systems.\r\n\r\nNote that this does _not_ yet make the switch to libevent for outgoing connections, that work is happening in parallel, and will be easier to merge after this.\r\n\r\nAlso, for any reviewers, several of these commits would individually introduce some regressions or slow-downs, but they've been split up in order to clarify why some of the changes are being made.\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- Add a ton of documentation\r\n- RAII the libevent structures\r\n- Add some tests where possible",
