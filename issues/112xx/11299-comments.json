Your first commits look good, but my view of #10929 is that there are a lot of edge cases to think about before this will be in a useful state. I don't see huge benefit from the feature, but there may be others who do.\r\n\r\nFor me there are much more interesting features to be worked on, but I certainly wouldn't concept NACK this if you feel strongly that it would be useful to lots of users. Feel free to contact me on irc or slack.",
