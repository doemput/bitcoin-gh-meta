   "body" : "This PR implements an index of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\n\nThis approach optimizes `CWallet::AvailableCoins`, by doing some of its work each time a wallet transaction changes. For instance, using `CWallet::IsMine` earlier for each transaction output, it manages to keep track only of UTXOs related to wallet addresses.\n\nThat brings large improvements on RPCs such as `listunspent` and `fundrawtransaction`. Depending on the size of your wallet and number of UTXOs, performance gains may be up to 98%.\n\nThis way, instead of going through all the wallet transactions, the search for UTXOs is made only on this updated list of outputs.\n\nDepends on #7822 to ensure functionality behaviour remains the same.\n",
