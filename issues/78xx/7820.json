   "body" : "This moves the CFeeRate and dust code out of libconsensus and the consensus module.\nBefore that, it prepares an empty CPolicy interface and implementation where the dust methods are moved to. It also encapsulates the global minRelayTxFee behind the CPolicy interface.\nSince this may be too disruptive for one PR, I was very careful to separate things in smaller commits.\nThe first commit, for example, may be useful for @jonasschnelli 's work encapsulating the wallet.\n\nThis is also intended to replace @morcos' #7557, #6068 and #5114.\n",
