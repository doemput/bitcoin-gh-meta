   "body" : "`AlreadyHave` is called for transactions in 3 places:\r\n- when an INV is received to decide whether to schedule a request of the tx\r\n- when a TX is received to decide whether to process it\r\n- when actually requesting a tx to see if it has been received since scheduling the request\r\n\r\nIn a large number of these cases, the transaction in question is new and fails each of the tests in the return statement.  In particular it is very unlikely (< 10%) to hit the `pcoinsTip` check and then be found.  But `pcoinsTip` must check the database to be sure it can't find the transaction.  Switching the full `HaveCoins` check for the fast `HaveCoinsInCache` check will still prevent the vast majority of false negatives but will never need a database access.  The downside is after the cache has been flushed there maybe be a very few more cases of requesting already confirmed transactions from peers.",
