And, of course, if you\r\nhave any questions about that particular PR, please try to ask them\r\nthere instead of here.\r\n\r\nIt was also the first dependency in the list, so now I can cross it from the list, great! this PR/issue gets closer to get closed without being merged.\r\nI also created #7876, and updated the list with more things that need to be done.\r\n\r\nI expect you pick one of them (I suggest ConnectBlock() as the next easiest one), create your PR for it and say it here so that I link to your PR in the dependency list for that one.\r\nThis way we can avoid that two people work on the same function.\r\n\r\nIf somebody wants to do more than one, that's fine, I'm not worried about running out of ideas to tell other people to do yet.\r\n\r\nBut I suggest waiting for the first you open to be merged before opening another one. These changes are generally good and likely to be merged, but they're not a priority. So if you try to do too much of this at once you may end up suffering what is known as a \"rebase mouse-wheel\" (forgive me, I can't remember who I heard this term from). If you don't mind needing to rebase more times, fine.\r\nBut my advice is to start with little and progressively increase your load as you see fit. \r\n",
