EQUALVERIFY` part to fail when testing the signature in here:\r\n\r\n    ProduceSignature(DummySignatureCreator(&keystore), scriptPubKey, scriptSig) ? ISMINE_WATCH_SOLVABLE : ISMINE_WATCH_UNSOLVABLE;\r\n\r\nThat evaluates to `ISMINE_WATCH_UNSOLVABLE` even though it is actually solvable, and so stops any of my outputs being considered for inclusion. `output.fSpendable` is `false` for each output when `CWallet::SelectCoinsMinConf()` runs.",
