For all I know this could be a bug or a backdoor. IMHO this could be improved by calculating the constant at runtime in a more obviously correct way such as:\r\n\r\n    nStartTime = BLOCK_TIMESTAMP_FROM_DATE(2016, 3, 1);\r\n\r\nThis requires a suitable macro or preferrably a constexpr function.\r\n\r\nI would request that this improvement to the source code be made in the interest of reviewability.",
