Using default options, with bitcoin-cli, call importprivkey (or I assume importaddress or importpubkey too).\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nCall should succeed.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nbitcon-cli will timeout after 15 minutes, per default -rpcclienttimeout, exit with code 1. Bitcoind will complete the command in the background.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n 58861ad9\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Debian stretch\r\n- CPU: i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz\r\n- RAM: 16018 Mb\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): HD\r\n\r\nAdjusting -rpcclienttimeout, the call takes 27 minutes on my machine. \r\n\r\nI can see 3 options for solving this:\r\n\r\n1. Increase the default -rpcclienttimeout. It appeared to be cpu bound. There are probably a not insignificant amount of  people with slower cpus which take 1 hour or more. I can test on a raspberry pi. I assume the time is roughly linearly proportional to the blockchain size, which will double in 2 years time or so. So a default timeout which is expected to work for most people for a few years could be 3 hours or more. The timeout was last changed via commit 2190ea6c4e7f5 in September 2015, changing it from 30 seconds to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Increase the default -rpcclienttimeout only when a rescan is requested. I'm not sure if this is the only call which needs a higher timeout. \r\n\r\n3. Add a warning in the help output for calls which trigger a rescan about the default -rpcclienttimeout being too low.\r\n",
