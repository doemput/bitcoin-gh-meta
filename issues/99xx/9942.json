   "body" : "This moves towards disentangling CBlockPolicyEstimator from CTxMemPool by making it its own global object.  At the end of this PR, the CTxMemPool still has to know about CBlockPolicyEstimator, but this lays the ground work so that in the future CBlockPolicyEstimator can just subscribe to transaction and block events and the mempool will know nothing about it.\r\n\r\nThe last two commits are preparation for future work where there will be multiple TxConfirmStats in the CBlockPolicyEstimator which all refer to the same set of buckets.\r\n\r\nI've grouped the commits into this PR, because this is the of the commits which introduces no change into the fee estimates, so is possible to merge cleanly by itself.  There are a set of major changes to fee estimation built on top of this that isn't finished yet.\r\n",
