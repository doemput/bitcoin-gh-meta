Command-line options override\r\n       values set in the configuration file.\r\n\r\n       The configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with optional comments\r\n       starting with the '#' character. Please refer to bitcoind(1) for a up to date list of valid\r\n       options.\r\n\r\n       The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-\r\n       text editor. By default, bitcoind(1) will look for a file named bitcoin.conf(5) in the bitcoin data\r\n       directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the\r\n       '-datadir' and '-conf' command-line arguments.\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\n       bitcoin.conf should be located in $HOME/.bitcoin\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO\r\n       bitcoind(1)\r\n\r\nAUTHOR\r\n       This manual page was written by Micah Anderson <micah@debian.org> for the Debian system (but may be\r\n       used by others).
