Are you going to rewrite it from scratch? Who will do that work (p2pool took months if not more to develop)? Who will use it, given that hardware owners these days don't even run bitcoin nodes anymore?\n\nWriting the wallet in a web-like way... ok... Qt (what we're using now for the GUI) allows styling using css and other web-like elements already. What do you suggest doing? Rewrite it? Tweak it? Do you have any plan for accomplishing that?\n\nIn short: vague ideas are easy. The hard part is executing them.
