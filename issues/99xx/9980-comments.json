This code is only called from the CMerkleBlock constructor, which is only called from the gettxoutproof RPC or in response to a MSG_FILTERED_BLOCK getdata request. In both cases, we're constructing the Merkle Block from a block that's already in our mapBlockIndex. Therefore to hit this assert, we'd need there to be an invalid block in the mapBlockIndex, which would mean:\r\n\r\n- our internal data is corrupted; and\r\n- we've probably fallen pretty badly out of consensus\r\n\r\nin which case, asserting is appropriate.\r\n\r\nAs for concerns about future code calling this without knowing about the assert - they'd have to be constructing a merkle block for a block that they hadn't already validated, which is a very bad idea! Just to make sure, Chris has now also added a comment above the assert to clarify assumptions.\r\n\r\nHope that allays your concerns!",
