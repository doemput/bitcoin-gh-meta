   "body" : "It's possible to have several parts of a private key that are only useful when combined. This might be used for vanity addresses, or for a split key with parts stored in separate locations that need to be combined to sweep or spend. Today, combining the private key parts requires the use of in-browser tools, or otherwise obtaining (and potentially compiling) tools like `keyconv` in the [samr7/vanitygen](https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen) source code. This may be a feature rather than a bug, but it is not particularly simple and often insecure.\r\n\r\nIt could be better to implement this support into Bitcoin Core instead.\r\n\r\nI do not think this support should be added to `importprivkey`. This could be implemented with the following new RPC/command:\r\n\r\n`importprivkeyparts \"bitcoinAddress\" \"label\" rescan \"part1\" \"part2\" ... \"partN\"`\r\n\r\n`bitcoinAddress` would be either empty to indicate no part contribution from that address or a valid Bitcoin address associated with the user's wallet. In the case of a valid address, the private key for the Bitcoin address would be used as an additional part in the combination -- a `part0`, if you will.\r\n\r\n`label` and `rescan` would work the same as they do in `importprivkey` today.\r\n\r\n`part1`, `part2`, etc would be the individual private key parts in WIF. At least one part would need to be specified.\r\n\r\nThe actual implementation would simply add the private key parts (modulo the curve's order) and then perform the same operation as `importprivkey` using the resulting combined private key.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to add UI for this but I suspect it's not an operation to broadly endorse with a presence in the UI, but rather should require the use of the console, cli, or jsonrpc to use.",
