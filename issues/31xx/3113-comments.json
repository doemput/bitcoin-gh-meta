But for instance if there was some awesome transaction, like 'kickstarter'. Which people were trying to popularize, it would be shame if the clients people use didnt support it. In such case, a list of scripts to recommend support for migh be a good idea.\r\n\r\nDont think the current scripting allows for something like kickstarter though!.. I do kindah hold that against some of the altcoins a bit, not at all innovating on transactions.(excepting ethereum, of course! but altcoins wouldnt have to go *that* far) The starting altcoins dont need to deal with a live blockchain, so they dont have much excuse..",
