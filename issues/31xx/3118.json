The newly created address/accounts will not be added to the wallet. and any preceding call will fail. getinfo() etc...\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue which is a NON issue simply download the desired bitcoind and simply execute it with the command one time\r\n\r\nbitcoind.exe -upgradewallet\r\n\r\nThis simple error which is not technically an error cost me a great deal of time energy and effort. \r\n\r\nThe issue 916 is reproducible by running bitcoind with an out of date wallet pre 0.8 since this issue was closed i had to create this post here. Hopefully this will allow the developers to recreate the problem which they could not create before.    ",
