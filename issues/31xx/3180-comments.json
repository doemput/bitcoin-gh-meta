ProcessMessages will only process one message at a time so one message will be parsed from each node with outstanding messages to process rather than processing all outstanding messages from each node before moving on the the next.\r\n3. Don't sleep if there are still outstanding messages to be processed, this alone should improve performance.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not particularly well versed in the bitcoin codebase this commit has my ACK on a code basis.\r\n\r\nI have built and tested it on my laptop and a vm which I -connect=<my laptop> and it synced the chain just fine.\r\nMy laptop is showing surprisingly high processor load but it's also serving a lot of block downloads on the order of 100kB-1500kB/s upload speed. Does anyone know if 100% processor load on one core is normal for bitcoin under these circumstances? I want to be sure there is no perf regression in the ProcessMessages codepath since it drops out of the function for each message when there are multiple messages stacked.",
