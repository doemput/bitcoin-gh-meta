For example, an attacker may create symlinks in a race pointing to an arbitrary file the user owns that he wishes to corrupt. Boost may guarantee a unique filename, but there is a split-second before we open that file for an attacker to set up a link.\r\n\r\nThis was fixed by mkstemp which ensures the file is newly created securely. We should do something similar.",
