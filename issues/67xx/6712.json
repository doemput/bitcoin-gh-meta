Changing only the confirmation time setting to within 2 blocks gave medium priority and allowed a zero-fee transaction.\r\n\r\nThe expected result of a faster confirmation time setting is a recommended transaction fee greater than or equal to a slower confirmation time setting. In this instance the recommended BTC/kB fee increased, but not the overall fee paid because the priority change allowed for a zero-fee transaction.",
