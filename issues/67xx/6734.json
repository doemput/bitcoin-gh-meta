Typically, it is packaged by distributions as something like libzmq-dev.\r\n\r\nBut see http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software which marks even libzmq 3.x as \"legacy\"; they follow semver and have major incompatibilities between major version field changes. Recent versions of libzmq should be compiled from source from [here](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software) instead of APT repos.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can't have sockets from 2.x and 3.x talk to 4.x anyway.",
