I restarted bitcoind and even spent a few days to reindex DB, with no luck. Does this mean that my laptops 5400 RPM HDD is not fast enough to run full node? Or does it mean that it is a bug? bitcoin.conf is almost empty. Only rpc username, password and non-standard network port number there. Thanks for any clues.\r\nvay",
