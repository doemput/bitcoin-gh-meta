   "body" : "This fixes test_bitcoin failures on openbsd reported by dhill on IRC.\r\n\r\n  On some systems rand() is a simple LCG over 2^31 and so it produces\r\nan even-odd sequence.  ApproximateBestSubset was only using the least\r\nsignificant bit and so every run of the iterative solver would be the\r\nsame for some inputs, resulting in some pretty dumb decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing something other than the least significant bit would paper over\r\nthe issue but who knows what other way a system's rand() might get us\r\nhere.  Instead we use an internal RNG with a period of something like\r\n2^60 which is well behaved.  This also makes it possible to make the\r\nselection deterministic for the tests, if we wanted to implement that.",
