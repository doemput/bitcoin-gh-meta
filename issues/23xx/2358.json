   "body" : "First, I acknowledge being technologically illiterate, so I hope I'll be able to adequately explain my problem. Last evening, I tried to download Bitcoin into my computer, but I believe the download was unsuccessful. At least, I don't believe I am able to use the system, and I am eager to become a participant.\r\n\r\nThe current status of my attempt to join is that when I open my Wallet window, I get the following message: \"Urgent, chain fork, stop mining on Version .8\"\r\n\r\nI didn't even know I was 'mining.' I was just trying to download the program. Also, both the 'wallet' and 'recent transactions' values show this (in red letters): \"out of sync\"\r\n\r\nDuring the download process, I was watching the progress, as there was an ongoing tabulation of 'remaining blocks,' as the process reported it was \"synchronizing with the network.\" Unfortunately, this was taking several hours to complete, and when it got down to a little over 30,000 blocks remaining, I fell asleep, and my computer shut off. Everything had been seemingly going fine until then, but when I turned my computer back on, and tried to resume the download, that's when I got the messages I've referred to above. \r\n\r\nI thought, well, I guess I'll have to start the whole process over again, so I uninstalled the Bitcoin program altogether, but when I reinstalled it, it went right back to where it had left off, and repeated the \"Urgent, chain fork, stop mining\" warning. So, I closed out the Wallet window again, and that's where it sits now. \r\n\r\nI want to become a Bitcoin participant, but I don't know how I'll be able to overcome this problem to do so. Help with moving forward from here will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
