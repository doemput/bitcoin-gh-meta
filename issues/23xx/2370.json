Loaded up the client, then as soon as the main window came up I filled out the transaction details and clicked send. The client then proceeded to connect to the peers, synchronise everything, and when it was done, the transaction still had 0 confirmations and was not transmitted to any peer. Waited for a minute, restarted the client, still nothing. I issued an identical transaction again, that one sent (and confirmed), while I still can see the old transaction sitting in my client doing nothing.",
