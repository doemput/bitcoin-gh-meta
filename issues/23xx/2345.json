   "body" : "The bitcoin network could have built in and automated monitoring and prevention measures to prevent any group from controlling 51% of the network.\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution is to divide network hash rate,or block generation submission rate, by unique miner ips over some interval to provide caps on accepting new proof of work units from the same ip address over short time intervals.\r\n\r\nThe next level of security would be to prevent high frequency submissions from some kind of ip address cycling from sources with assigned ip address blocks.\r\n\r\nI thought of this mainly as an ipv4 measure, as I'm not sure how ipv6 can be used to help prevent 51% take overs.\r\n\r\nThe affect of this is that disruptive technologies can no longer monopolize network hashing power when used from a few or single ip addresses, and indirectly miner payouts of blocks and transaction fees will be moderated during transitions to asic and other future technologies.
