   "body" : "Problem: bitcoin-qt disconnects from peer when downloading blocks with fast connection.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. install a fresh copy bitcoin-qt on a computer, with no blocks saved\r\n2. start bitcoin-qt with -connect= to a client with updated blockchain, and on a local area network (or any fast connection)\r\n\r\nAfter downloading for a few seconds, the block downloading process will halt, and bitcoin (the one that's downloading) will be idle for a few minutes before restarting again.\r\n\r\nI believe the problem is caused by this pull request: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/72/files , as setting maxreceivebuffer=500000 in bitcoin.conf resolves this issue.",
