For example, the qt client doesn't have a lot of the\nfunctionality bitcoind has.\n\nThis leads to the creation of a myriad of unmaintained scripts in\ncontrib. For example, the walletunlock.py script mentionned above, while\nit doesn't show the password in the history or on the commandline, does\nshow it in the prompt. It also doesn't read the RPC password from\nbitcoin.conf...\n\nI believe this should simply be fixed in the regular bitcoind client.\n\nThanks for the feedback.",
