I don't believe this is the inteded behaviour. I would suggest removing the oddness check, since vTimeOffsets is capable of returning the median value of an even list according to the median method of the CMedianFilter type.\r\n\r\nIn current master, the offending code is in src/timedata.cpp, line 52, columns 34-64:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif (vTimeOffsets.size() >= 5 && vTimeOffsets.size() % 2 == 1)\r\n```\r\nThis should better be:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif (vTimeOffsets.size() >= 5)\r\n```",
