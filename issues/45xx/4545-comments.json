      "body" : "Hello. Just FYI, I ended up poking around the Core code recently and saw the comparison tool. While poking around and trying to troubleshoot some stuff, I discovered that [comparison tool support seems to have been dropped from the forthcoming v0.14](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/commit/1eaf05cacf35ebdf8e716eb84f0d5d0c051b3398). For that matter, v0.13.6 doesn't work without a [one-line fix](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/issues/1236#issuecomment-202777012), and even then, I've seen an intermittent DB error that I can't reproduce right now.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just wanted to add that here in case this is still on anybody's radar. My Java experience is limited, and it sounds like nobody's really happy with the tool anyway, so I'm really not the right person to tackle this project. Besides, I don't think there will be a v0.13.7 release, so as things stand, the tool is completely broken.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: [There might be a v0.13.7 after all](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/issues/1236#issuecomment-207735553). Not sure if the aforementioned fix would make it in but I'll ask for it.",

I.e. fail on assertion errors, etc.?\r\n\r\nEdit: Yes, Apparently it writes: `ERROR: bitcoind and bitcoinj acceptance differs ...`.\r\n\r\nIf they don't and no one knows how to fix, we can remove them right now. Because the only thing they'd be doing then, is slowing down travis.",
