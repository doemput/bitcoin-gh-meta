That's likely to hurt more than help. In this case, qt build\r\nfailed, and on the second attempt, it appeared to be successful. However, due\r\nto a bad object from an internal gcc error on the first build, the resulting\r\nlib was unusable. This caused bitcoin-qt to not be built, and tests and\r\npackaging which expected bitcoin-qt to be there failed.\r\n\r\nThe root cause:\r\nMingw is especially crashy when using -jX, likely compounded by low-memory\r\nenvironments. I've seen multiple problems with this combo in Gitian as well.\r\n\r\nIn this case:\r\ni686-w64-mingw32-g++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)\r\n...\r\nmake[3]: *** [.obj/release/qdrawhelper.o] Error 4\r\n\r\nThe workaround:\r\nBump Travis down to using -j2 by default. Additionaly, enable --with-gui for\r\nthe windows builds. This will cause configure to fail if qt is not working\r\nwhile also testing the config flag.\r\n\r\nOther failures which may be worth revisiting separately:\r\n- If a depends package fails, maybe remove the workdir so that it doesn't taint\r\n  subsequent runs\r\n- See if there's anything repeatable about the ICE when building qt",
