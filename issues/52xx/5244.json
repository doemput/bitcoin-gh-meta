Many packagers (for example at various linux distros) include them as source in their packages, and it is desireable for an end user to be able to verify that the source code used to build a package is unmodified.\r\nThe only current way to achieve this includes cloning and verifying the git repo and diff it against the sources that the packager used, but it's alot of overhead imo.",
