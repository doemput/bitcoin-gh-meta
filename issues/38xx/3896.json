   "body" : "I created a valid, signed transaction with nearly 28 kb length and faced several problems.\r\n\r\nWithin the -Qt debug window of v0.9.0.0-gd6e0e17-beta (64-bit):\r\n\r\n - decoderawtransaction with \"hex-of-unsigned-transaction* worked fine.\r\n\r\n - decoderawtransaction with *hex-of-signed-transaction* failed with error \"TX decode failed (code -22)\". I noticed that the input textbox only allows a text length of 32767 characters at most.\r\n\r\n - sendrawtransaction with *hex-of-signed-transaction* failed for the same reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I tried to broadcast the transaction via RPC:\r\n\r\n - decoderawtransaction with *hex-of-signed-transaction* worked.\r\n\r\n - sendrawtransaction with *hex-of-signed-transaction* failed with the error \"TX rejected (code -22)\", if I remember correctly. I'm unable to replicate the error, because I already broadcasted the transaction otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe same problem appeared on [Eligius' pushtx box](http://eligius.st/~wizkid057/newstats/pushtxn.php).\r\n\r\nI was able to broadcast the transaction successfully via the console of Electrum v1.9.8 (connected to electrum.no-ip.org:50002).\r\n\r\nFetching the broadcasted transaction with \"getrawtransaction 16a41567e402b9d6fdede7f56eabf2ca64036b9c4b95f063c27bd5713ca72e74\" works like a charm both in -Qt as well as via RPC.",
