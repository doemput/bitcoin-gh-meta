Then when I looked in the GUI it told me that \"-spendzeroconfchange\" was set on the command line (it wasn't), but the \"spend unconfirmed change\" option in the GUI was checked.\r\n\r\nThe text told me the command line option was overriding the above options - does that mean that even though the checkbox was checked, it wasn't really going to spend unconfirmed change?  If so, that's very confusing.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to refer to the option as \"spendzeroconfchange\" (omit the 'no'), and have the GUI reflect the true state of the options.",
