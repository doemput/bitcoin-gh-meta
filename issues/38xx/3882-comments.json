      "body" : "I agree that completely seperating wallet and network deamon would be a good idea. I think the first step towards that would be an explicit decision whether the wallet should use the network component as a library or via the existing RPC interface. The former would probably faster to develop and may generate a smoother end-user experience, but on the other hand the rpc interface could greatly benefit from being used for the official wallet. Also, if the wallet only communicates via RPC with bitcoind, that would simplyfy dogecoind to only one interface.",
