I have noticed this with at least the strDataDir option.\r\n\r\nReplication steps on Ubuntu 15.10\r\n\r\n1. Tail ~/.config/Bitcoin-Qt.conf and ~/.config/Bitcoin-Qt-testnet.conf\r\n2. Reset the testnet settings by going to Settings > Reset Options. Notice how the testnet conf file changes.\r\n3. Now start Bitcoin core with `-choosedatadir -testnet`.\r\n\r\nAfter the third step, you will see that the strDataDir setting is not added to the testnet conf but is added/changed in the normal conf file.",
