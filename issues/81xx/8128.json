The changed lines count is high, but it's mostly tests.\r\n\r\nCNetAddr/CService/CSubNet lose their string constructors, they must now have lookup operations performed externally. This means that functions/classes that depend on them are no longer dependent on any particular lookup mechanism.\r\n\r\nFrom a high level: New resolvers/parsers may now be used for net operations. libbtcnet will replace what remains of netbase with async versions.",
