      "body" : "I'm working on a fork off of Bitcoin core to implement zerocash. We require C++11 due to dependencies (eg [``libsnark``](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark)).\r\n\r\nIt's not much effort to make C++11 compile, link, run, and pass ``make check``. Hidden changes to consensus are another matter which we don't have a solid grasp on.\r\n\r\nWe've been working on a fork off of both v0.10.0 and v0.11.2 with g++ ``-std=c++11``. This has required a few modifications to the upstream bitcoin code, different in each of these branches. Here are some notes (though I may be forgetting details).\r\n\r\nFirst, some strong caveats:\r\n\r\n* Our only testing of consensus changes has been ``make check``, so the following notes are only a starting point for C++11 support in bitcoin core. (**Edit:** -because we haven't done rigorous consensus regression testing. Any advice here would be greatly appreciated.)\r\n* On top of this, on our branch atop v0.10.0, we disabled many tests that had hard-coded test vectors (such as serialized structures from production main-net) rather than correctly fixing the tests.\r\n* On v0.11.2 we have not disabled any upstream tests, and have only added C++11 mode and linked in our extra dependencies. (The v0.10.0 is a messy proof of concept. Now we're starting fresh with more rigour.)\r\n* We only test/develop on debian or arch linux with non-\"default' packages installed. Furthermore we only build with the depends system, something close to ``make -C ./depends NO_QT=1 && ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=./depends/Ã¢ÂÂ¦ --with-gui=no CXXFLAGS='-O0 -g' && make V=1``\r\n* No one on our team has a strong C++ background. :-<\r\n\r\nSo, I scanned through our deltas from upstream to hunt down changes I believe are necessitated by C++11 support:\r\n\r\n* We've found that upgrading to boost 1.57.0 atop v0.10.0, or to either boost 1.57.0 or 1.59.0 atop bitcoin v0.11.2 resolves the linker error in @laanwj 's original comment.\r\n\r\n  - The patches in ``./depends/patches/boost`` do not apply to boost 1.57.0 (and we haven't tried them 1.59.0). I examined the 1.57.0 code to see if I could update the patches, but couldn't find relevant target code after about an hour of effort, so I gave up and *deleted these patches*! (I asked in ``#bitcoin-dev`` about this and at least one person told me that's *probably* ok because upstream *probably* addressed the same patched issue.)\r\n\r\n* Boost's ``list_of(x)(y)(z)`` syntax didn't work (for boost 1.57.0 atop bitcoin v0.10.0), so we switched to C++11 initializer syntax ``{ x, y, z }``.\r\n* In bitcoin v0.11.2 there is one unit test that relies on exceptions propagating out of a dtor: [``src/test/reverselock_tests.cpp`` L52-L58 at ``7e278929``](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7e278929df53e1fb4191bc5ba3176a177ce718bf/src/test/reverselock_tests.cpp#L52-L58). In C++11 this causes a process to abort unless you explicitly add an attribute to the dtor as in ``~reverse_lock() noexcept(false) {Ã¢ÂÂ¦}``.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. If I had time I'd work on this PR directly, but I can't promise anything.",

I believe the plan is to try to recycle some of it for the eventual Core commit. It would be nice to know if C++11 will be acceptable so that everybody working on the Core patch(es) can use or modify code as necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso, I agree with @sipa. AFAIK, any library issues would come up as linker errors. I'm not aware offhand of any massive gotchas that would come with a switch to GCC 5 and a bit of time for distros to recompile everything. (AFAIK, Ubuntu did most of that before releasing 15.10, although it sounds like more work is needed for 16.04.) If anybody's aware of any specific issues, I'm all ears.",
