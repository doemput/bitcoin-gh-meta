I am trying to figure this out on my own, but any guidance toward making the changes and pull request would be great.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that updateLabels is being continuously called.

Heres a log with some timers on the functions. selecting 300 inputs at a time.\r\nhttp://pastebin.com/SQtJidHy",
