      "body" : "I think this change is good and don't mean to go off topic.  It does move a little toward more historical info and less real-time info, by not marking unconfirmed conflicts as visibly.  There is a lot going on in those few minutes.  It's good to see the wallet providing more information and hopefully soon, more control.\r\n\r\nSince you asked, I think the first non-clone conflict of a mempool tx should be relayed, and added to the wallet if the wallet conflicts, with some protections.",
