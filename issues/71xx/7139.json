   "body" : "I am running bitcoin-qt from master. I use openbox which lets me access my app menu by right clicking on my desktop. Often times when bitcoin-qt is running, i cant access my desktop right click menu anymore. It doesnt happen right away, but after bitcoin-qt is running for a while. I know it is bitcoin-qt that is doing it because as soon as I close it my desktop menu is accessible again. I know this is a hard one to track since I cant duplicate it every time, but I thought I would report it so we can start verifying if others are experiencing it. ",
