It will instantly detect (and remove the entry) when connectivity is reestablished when  receives a RST as the other side (or router in case of NAT) doesn't know of the open connection.\r\nB) Ping time can only be updated if a ping is in progress.\r\n\r\nThough it could be improved somewhat: right now I think the ping time is only updated if the `pong` message is received, it could instead report the status of the last ping in progress (and like LastReceive count up if there is no answer).",
