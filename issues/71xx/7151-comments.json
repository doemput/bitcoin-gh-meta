Of course I think we will find those, I send those myself, but that doesn't mean those users won't adapt.\r\n\r\nJust to summarize some of the reasons to deprecate priority:\r\n- code complexity: I think the computational complexity can be kept within reason at least for the existing functionality, but the code touches a lot of different places and it makes it more difficult to do perhaps more important work in those areas.\r\n- long term viability: If it's not incentive compatible, how long should we go about trying to put effort into supporting it.\r\n- it's currently broken: With mempool limiting not respecting priority its almost a useless concept anyway.  \r\n- we're not foreclosing on the possibility of some future notion of coin age: Perhaps we can regain most of the lost benefits of the existing priority metric with something like sipa's proposed coin age based fee delta.  Or even just a cleaner and more general way to implement a different metric that doesn't require so much core maintenance.",

I'm just saying that if you look at the last tx in the 50k priority block (so the lowest priority tx that made it into the block by priority) you will discover its priority is almost always above 1e10, maybe closer to 1e12 typically.  What this means is that a tx that pays too low a fee and is hoping to get into a block based on priority, it'll need to wait until its priority is that high to have a chance.",

I looked at 6 weeks of data starting Oct 1st and only at blocks which had at least 100 txs.  I then assumed that the last 10 txs in each of those blocks were fee based txs.  And the lowest fee of those 10 txs was the necessary fee to be included in the block.  So I looked for each block at how many txs were in it that had a fee less than what would have been necessary to be included in at least 2 out of the next 10 blocks, and I assumed those were the txs that benefited by priority.   This amounted to 56K out of 6.7M txs or 0.83%.",
