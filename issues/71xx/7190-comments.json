I'm just saying you don't have to recalculate the time/height at which the sequence locks are valid which is the expensive part.\r\nWith your solution I think you will still be recalculating sequence locks for a significant fraction of the mempool on a reorg which is slow and destroys your utxo cache.\r\n",
