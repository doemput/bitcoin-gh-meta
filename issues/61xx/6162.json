   "body" : "This prevents an integer overflow during the difficulty retarget\r\ncalculation, and fixes a consensus-changing bug introduced by\r\ndf9eb5e14fa8072bc8a82b59e712c2ba36f13f4c.  While it is not possible to\r\nhit this consensus bug on mainnet or testnet3 due to the higher\r\ncurrent difficulties, it is easily hit on regtest after generating\r\n2016 blocks, forcing the retarget.\r\n\r\n~~Note: to convert between the arith_uint256 and arith_uint512 classes, I created a new static function in the base_uint base class that copies the data from one to the other.  However, to do this, I had to make the protected members `WIDTH` and `pn` public, so they could be accessed.  Not too happy with this, and I think that I need to use `friend` to allow access, but I'm not sure exactly how to do that.  Suggestions welcome.~~",
