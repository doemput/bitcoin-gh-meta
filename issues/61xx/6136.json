I'd prefer to check the build log of this PR itself before merge, but I think all should be OK as-is.\r\n\r\nIn some cases (Travis), sources and build caches may be moved around in-between builds, and we can't necessarily trust that everything is still intact. In particular, this should properly detect and recover from Travis corruption that came up this week.\r\n\r\nThis introduces pre-build checks that verify against stashed checksums.\r\n\r\nNote that this will cause all sources to be re-downloaded, since (moved) cached sources weren't completely trustworthy before this.",
