   "body" : "Previously due to an off-by-one error the wallet ignored nLockTime-by-height transactions that would be valid in the next block even though they are accepted into the mempool. The transactions wouldn't show up until confirmed, nor would they be included in the unconfirmed balance. Similar to the mempool behavior fix in 665bdd3b, the wallet code was calling IsFinalTx() directly without taking into account the fact that doing so tells you if the transaction could have been mined in the *current* block, rather than the next block.\r\n\r\nInstead of changing the wallet code, this commit simply changes the semantics of IsFinalTx() when the block height isn't provided to use the height of the next block. The resulting semantics return true if the transaction in question could included in the next block, significantly less confusing and more useful than the previous semantics.",
