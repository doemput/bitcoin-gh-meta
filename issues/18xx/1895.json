   "body" : "Corrupt wallets used to cause a DB_RUNRECOVERY uncaught exception and a\r\ncrash. This commit does three things:\r\n\r\n1) Runs a BDB verify early in the startup process, and if there is a\r\nlow-level problem with the database:\r\n  + Moves the bad wallet.dat to wallet.timestamp.bak\r\n  + Runs a 'salvage' operation to get key/value pairs, and\r\n    writes them to a new wallet.dat\r\n  + Continues with startup.\r\n\r\n2) Much more tolerant of serialization errors. All errors in deserialization\r\nare tolerated EXCEPT for errors related to reading keypairs\r\nor master key records-- those are reported and then shut down, so the user\r\ncan get help (or recover from a backup).\r\n\r\n3) Adds a new -salvagewallet option, which:\r\n + Moves the wallet.dat to wallet.timestamp.bak\r\n + extracts ONLY keypairs and master keys into a new wallet.dat\r\n + soft-sets -rescan, to recreate transaction history\r\n\r\nThis was tested by randomly corrupting testnet wallets using a little\r\npython script I wrote (https://gist.github.com/3812689)",
