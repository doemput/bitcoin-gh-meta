This approach would let one's application communicating with bitcoind to know about all the latest events from the program without having to poll it often. Some sample notifications could include:\r\n\r\n- New Tx appearing in the wallet with 0, 6 and other number of confirmations\r\n- New block appearing in the blockchain\r\n- A block being replaced in the blockchain\r\n- Balance changing in some account with 0, 6... confirmations",
