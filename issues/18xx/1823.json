   "body" : "The problem\n===========\n\n`SetCompact` as currently implemented interprets the compact number `0x01810000` as `-1` instead of `0x81`, because it is implemented using `BN_mpi2bn`, which interprets the highest bit in the first byte of its input as sign and this is not compensated for.  Ã¢ÂÂ  Currently this is not a problem as none of the bitcoin-implementations I've looked at generate compact numbers with the `0x00800000` bit set.  Many contain a matching bug in their compact encoding routines.\n\nSatoshi:\n * `CBigNum.GetCompact(0x81)` => `0x02008100`\n * `CBigNum.SetCompact(0x01810000)` => `-1`\n\n Defensive encoding.\n Decoding results in negative number with highest bit stripped.\n\nbitcoinj:\n * No compact encoding.\n * `Utils.decodeCompactBits(0x01810000)` => `-1`\n\n Decoding will lead to `Block::getDifficultyTargetAsInteger()` throwing a `VerificationException`.\n\nbitcoinjs:\n * `encodeDiffBits(0x80)` => `0x02008000`\n * `decodeDiffBits(0x01810000)` => `0x81` (OK)\n\n Defensive encoding and correct decoding\n\nlibbitcoin:\n * `big_number::compact(0x80)` => `0x02008000`\n * `big_number::set_compact(0x01810000)` => `-1`\n\n Defensive encoding.\n Decoding results in block_work() returning 0 and\n validate_block::check_proof_of_work returning false.\n\nThis branch\n===========\n\nThe first commit adds several test cases for `GetCompact()` and `SetCompact()`, including one showcasing the erroneous decoding.\n\nThe second commit reimplements `GetCompact()` and `SetCompact()` using shifts instead of going through the MPI-representation.\n\n`GetCompact()` now is careful not to generate compact numbers with the `0x00800000` bit set (`GetCompact(0xff)` yields `0x0200ff00` instead of `0x01ff0000`).  It results in identical compact numbers for positive inputs as the old code.\n\n`SetCompact` now interprets the compact number `0x01810000` as `0x81` instead of `-1`.",
