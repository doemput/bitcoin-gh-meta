   "body" : "`CBigNum::SetCompact()` and `CBigNum::GetCompact()`\n--------------------\n\nBecause my previous pull-request https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1823 which changed the semantics of `SetCompact()` and `GetCompact()` in an effectively backwards-compatible way was met with understandable skepticism I've prepared this branch, which provides a bit for bit compatible re-implementation and unit tests.\n\nPlease, pull at least the first commit of either of the branches.  They only contain unit-tests making sure the semantic of `GetCompact()` and `SetCompact()` is not changed unintentionally.\n\nIf you agree that the semantics should not be changed, you should still pull the second commit of this branch if you agree that my re-implementation is easier to understand, more efficient, or both.",
