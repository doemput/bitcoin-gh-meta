The final return true should be return false and the input check should come before the time check (or left where it is and had its sense reversed). Would be a trivial fix except its a soft-forking change. ... and will probably require bumping the transaction version number as well as updating the block enforcing rules.\n\nIt's well known that _replacement_ didn't work, but nLockTime not being enforced in the chain was a surprise to me",
