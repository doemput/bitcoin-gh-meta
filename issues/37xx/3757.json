The first several links found from googling \"ubuntu ppa on debian\" leads me to believe that installing ubuntu ppa packages on debian is a bad idea. There should be a link or package that is meant for debian specifically. If the ubuntu package is really meant for debian,  which ubuntu version of the package to use on which version of debian should be stated.",
