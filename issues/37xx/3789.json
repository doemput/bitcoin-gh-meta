   "body" : "I'm using client 0.8.6 but this issue has existed for a while.  I am aware of this bug, but I don't think it's applicable since I'm still having the issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1242\r\n\r\nI installed bitcoin-qt from the PPA.  When I launch it, via my .xprofile file using the arguments -min and -splash=0, I INCONSISTENTLY get no tray icon.  I see the process running, but without a tray icon, I essentially can't switch to the app.\r\n\r\nI understand AwesomeWM on Ubuntu is a little bit of a strange setup, so the main issue to address is that the tray icon randomly shows or doesn't show on boot.\r\n\r\nIf it's any help, litecoin-qt has the same behavior.  If one icon shows, the other shows as well.  The behavior is linked to both.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any debug/output info is needed.",
