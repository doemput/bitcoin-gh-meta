      "body" : "The best option, the one that has consistently worked, is what C-Otto suggested.  To use the squeeze repo.\r\n\r\nFor this ONE thing, it is good, and the only way on Debian 7 to get this package through apt-get.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend building from source. When I did, that caused all sorts of issues with other dependencies related to other cryptos.  No idea why it was any different in this case.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to get libdb4.8++-dev while you're at it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, after using that repo in your.sources list don't forget to uncomment it immediately afterwards so that you don't end up with something that really IS incompatible.\r\n\r\nusing oldstable does not work, btw.  Only using the squeeze. I'm assuming that's because wheezy likely never included 4.8.",
