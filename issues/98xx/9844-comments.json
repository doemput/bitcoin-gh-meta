No need to roll every single feature into bitcoin core.\r\n\r\nThe \"encrypt private keys on disk and in memory unless needed\" feature exists because that is functionality that can't be offered by an external tool.",

And they want their wallet data on their USB drive fully encrypted, incase they lose it somewhere they don't want people to know their transaction history and balance.  It would be much easier if the client could change the loaded wallet after its been started, by finding the wallet in a file explorer popup... and the file was fully encrypted on USB drive.\r\n\r\nI know I'm asking for a lot now...  imo the client should be able to open and close wallets, not just specify wallet file on startup via command line.  Are you trying to make something easy for everyone to use? Or just for software engineers?",
