This has the obvious implication of bloating the wallets unspent outputs, but that's something that can be resolved in a different way (e.g. sweep the wallet when there's not much fee pressure).\r\n\r\nAdding a greedy option is a surprisingly non-invasive change:\r\nhttps://github.com/RHavar/bitcoin/commit/0f30c4a36b0646f9ff4ac44c9dc936748548879c\r\n\r\n(just requires a bit of config setting pluming around it) \r\n\r\n",
