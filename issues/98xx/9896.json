   "body" : "Hi Bitcoin Core. I was going through the relase notes today to try the various new things. I noticed that getmemoryinfo returns 0 which i thought was suspicious. However everything seems to be working fine and the node runs without issue. However its only online between 10-15hours per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the issue\r\n\r\ntrying the new getmemoryinfo command, and it returns 0 memory used\r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\nYes. I tired restarting and the result was the same.\r\n\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n1. Type getmemoryinfo in debug console\r\n2. Read the output :)\r\n3. Profit\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nI am expecting it to match the memory used according to windows resource manager..\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nIt returns 0\r\n\r\n### Screenshots.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8888420/23443529/9e9773d6-fe2f-11e6-8cab-2172c388e4c2.png)\r\n\r\n(662.968 Kb allocated)\r\n\r\n`\r\n\r\n03:31:31\r\nÃ¯Â¿Â¼\r\ngetmemoryinfo\r\n\r\n\r\n03:31:31\r\nÃ¯Â¿Â¼\r\n{\r\n  \"locked\": {\r\n    \"used\": 0,\r\n    \"free\": 262144,\r\n    \"total\": 262144,\r\n    \"locked\": 0,\r\n    \"chunks_used\": 0,\r\n    \"chunks_free\": 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nBitcoin Core 0.14rc2 win64\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Windows 10 64bit home\r\n\r\n## Additonal info ##\r\n\r\nI am running the node with standard settings and no fancy startup arguments etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this report can be of some use, if not i apologise.
