      "body" : "Oh, sorry. Greedy as in it greedily picks a big-enough output immediately, instead of trying to clean up your wallet at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf I'm trying to sending X bitcoin, the current algorithm first filters for all unspent outputs that are < X BTC and then tries to use a subset of them to create the transaction.  This has the benefit of when you send bitcoin, you're generally cleaning up the wallet at the same time. \r\n\r\nThis used to be a good idea, but I'm not so sure anymore (at least for a large bitcoin user). For me to get transactions through \"on peak\" was costing ~150 sat/byte, yet I am able to clean up my wallet for <10 sat/byte on the weekend. \r\n\r\nSo the idea of a greedy option is to decouple this. I don't want my wallet cleaned up \"on peak\" and would rather use as few inputs as possible.",
