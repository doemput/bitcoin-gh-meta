I guess it just bothers me that so many users are say choosing Electrum first...  and then why would they switch to core after that?  Does Electrum have bugs, and then it makes them not want to use bitcoin for a while?\r\n\r\nThis is not an important feature for the technical functionality of Bitcoin to work.  Its only important if you want more users to use bitcoin core instead of Electrum etc.  If other clients are attracting users, and they are buggy, users won't like Bitcoin. They won't feel confident putting their money into Bitcoin.  It reduces the adoption rate of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nMy main concern right now is due to all of the people having low fee problems when they are using other clients.

That includes resource usage, synchronization time, and not the simplest possible user experience. We work on those things, and improve where possible, but we are limited by certain design choices.\n\nElectrum makes other trade-offs, and that's fine. If there are problems with Electrum's fee estimation, then go fix its fee estimation. While I'd like many users to want to appreciate the choices Bitcoin Core's wallet makes, the truth is that that is not for everyone. You can't expect Bitcoin Core to become better at what others choose to work with.",
