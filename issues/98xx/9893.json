   "body" : "Simple gzip compression can be very useful when you're dealing with a lot of getblocktemplate or getrawmempool requests. It decreases GBT latency and allows you to save a lot of bandwidth.\r\n\r\nJust for example, I have few instances of bitcoind which are being used as template sources for eloipool. Each getblocktemplate response has a size of ~2MB. Being gzipped it shrinks down to ~800KB, which is a fairly reasonable size. :)\r\n\r\n",
