We can ping their GitHub organization for a double check. \r\n\r\nI don't know if the issue you mentioned directly impacts the ephemeral services created by ADD_ONION in Bitcoin Core but when a bad configuration occurs then it is indeed a nasty side effect for all hardcoded onion services running through that particular Tor instance. \r\n\r\nI can think of tools like OnionShare, Ricochet that could potentially interfere with the daemon, but I have not tested that. A mention that this mode can have side effects is worth documenting to prevent accidents, but that's about all you can do.  ",

You have to alter the entire Tor instance and make it in non anonymous mode by adding 2 configuration options set to 1. \r\n\r\nSomething more important is that, as a security measure, Tor won't allow you to open a SocksPort in non-anonymous mode (if you set those 2 torrc configuration options) which means that you will not be able to connect to any other .onion nodes, you will only accept incoming connections on your .onion hostname (and do outgoing connections to other nodes on the clearnet, without Tor). Not to say this will also break all other applications that use Tor on that server.\r\n\r\nI think that this feature is unnecessary in Bitcoin Core. We assume who uses Bitcoin Core with Tor desires anonymity as well (maybe even partially). The users who don't want/need anonymity but use Tor and get it by default are not hurt, as opposite to those that want/need it but don't get it. Last but not least, it will be very hard to explain all this in few words that anyone can understand to the end users in order for them to take an informed decision and use the options correctly.\r\n\r\nP.S. the traffic generated (both incoming and outgoing) by a full node can be easily handled with 3-hop circuits. Single onion services exist for very large centralized web servers that need to handle > tens of thousands of users behind Tor. I don't think Bitcoin Core will ever need to connect to such a crazy amount of peers (nor it should so).",
