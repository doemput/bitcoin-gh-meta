   "body" : "Not sure if this is worthy of an issue, but I noticed something in the course of building some weekend-ware: https://estimatefee.com\r\n\r\nIt's currently 49m since the last block (453914) was found, and predictably there's an increase in the mempool. Right now `bitcoin-cli estimatefee 2` (on 0.13.2) is returning `0.00123063`\r\n\r\nHowever, if we plot the mempool by fees (blue line is 0.00123063 fee rate). We can see there's actually 2MiB of transactions that are already paying more:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1197\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-20 at 10 19 03 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9326759/23133232/0ba49c82-f756-11e6-859f-227811762504.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI also verified by applying a topological sort to the transactions (what older versions of core, and bitcoin unlimited do) and there is also >2MiB of transactions exceeding that fee rate.\r\n\r\nSo even if there wasn't a single new transaction created, our transaction at the estimatefee feerate will not make it in the next 2 blocks.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a known issue/limitation, so feel free to close if it's not useful.",
