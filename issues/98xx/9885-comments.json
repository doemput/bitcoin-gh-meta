I don't see anything there about making checkpoints and being able to start from a checkpoint.\r\n\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAlso I forgot to mention that when starting from a checkpoint, the user should probably use some other method other than the bitcoin network to verify that the highest block's hash & height & difficulty match what others have.  It might be worthwhile to verify block headers starting from the Genesis block to the checkpoint block, but I don't think this actually increases security, probably a waste.\r\n\r\nMore on security: I guess you could point out that the SPKCT could collude, and you could just be connected to them, and they might lie and give you false utxo data, and shield you from getting correct utxo data.  But then I could point out that if they are able to do that, then they could even do that with today's start from Genesis method.",

I went here with this one.\r\n\r\n@sipa thanks, I'll read through it.  I guess my idea isn't so novel after all, unless maybe my idea of having a CheckpointPeriod is new...  well and also I did not propose the UTXO commitment to be included in a block.  Man, I saw subjects about \"UTXO commitment\" in the mailing list but that didn't mean anything to me until you responded now.\r\n\r\nMaybe it could be included in the Checkpoint Block if the UTXO was split into an \"old\" and a \"new\", where \"new\" spans the last \"NewSpan-1\" blocks before the Checkpoint Block. Then the \"old\" UTXO hash could be calculated in the background while the new blocks are being built, and the Checkpoint Block would only be delayed by calculating the \"new\" UTXO hash.\r\n\r\nSorry just wanted to throw that out there now before I go to bed.  Will look at the mailing list tomorrow.",
