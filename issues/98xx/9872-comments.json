      "body" : "I think it would be better to have the new code in `MultiChainBitcoinTestFramework` replace the existing code in `BitcoinTestFramework` instead of selectively overriding it, given that it seems to be backwards compatible. All you would have to do is add a new optional named argument to `split_network` and `setup_network` and interpret it in the backwards compatible way when it is not specified. I guess I don't see a reason to add code duplication and complexity with a new `MultiChainBitcoinTestFramework` class (even temporarily with the \"ultimate intention\" of merging it later).\r\n\r\nAlso I think I would prefer a more flexible and predictable mechanism for splitting the network than the `chains` argument provides. What about a `splits` argument that takes a list of indices into self.nodes where splits should be inserted into the network? E.g. if you specify `num_nodes=6` and `splits=[1,3]` then node 0 would be standalone, nodes 1-2 would be connected, and nodes 3-5 would be connected. Other advantages of this scheme beyond more flexibility is that I think it would be more explicit and simpler to understand and implement since it wouldn't involve floating point calculations to figure out what the splits look like.",

I should have obviously given more thought to it..\r\n\r\nA more obvious use case (but still convoluted) is one of the tests I intend to write for #9622 once merged where\r\n```\r\n           aaa0\r\n      /     |     \\\r\na1         b1       c1-tx2'\r\na2-tx1'    b2-tx2   c2\r\na3         b3-tx1   c3\r\n```\r\nThere are two double spends in two separate chains. `tx1'` in `a2` is double spent as `tx1` in `b3`, and `c1-tx2'` in `b2`. A user does `listsinceblock a3` and should not get information about `c1-tx2'` in the results, but it should get information about `a2-tx1'`. A lot of discussion about this in theory went into that thread, and someone eventually suggested we make actual tests for this to ensure it works as intended.\r\n\r\nI agree to a certain extent that network stuff shouldn't affect things, but in reality, there is no strong guarantee that using the invalidate chain functionality will have the same effect as actually splitting the network (at least that's what it looks like, but I'm not entirely familiar with it (invalidateblock) so I need to look into it more closely). There could be bugs or subtle differences that make all the difference in how the nodes communicate and update their wallets or chain states.",
