Have Menu->Help->Enable/Disable Interactive Tutorial.  When switching from disable to enable, reset all \"first time\" flags.\r\n- The first time a user runs bitcoin, ask if they want a tutorial.  If Yes, then open a tutorial with screenshots and relevant FAQs.\r\n- Put Tutorial in Menu->Help->Tutorial\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.13.2",
