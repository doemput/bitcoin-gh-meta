   "body" : "Change ScanForWalletTransactions return value so it is possible to distinguish\r\nscans that skip reading every block (due to the nTimeFirstKey optimization)\r\nfrom scans that fail while reading the chainActive.Tip() block. Return value is\r\nnow non-null in the non-failing case.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't affect any user-visible behavior, it is only an internal\r\nAPI improvement. The only code currently using the ScanForWalletTransactions\r\nreturn value is in importmulti, and importmulti always calls\r\nScanForWalletTransactions with a pindex pointing to the first block in\r\nchainActive whose block time is >= (nLowestTimestamp - 7200), while\r\nScanForWalletTransactions would only return null without reading blocks when\r\npindex and every block after it had a block time < (nTimeFirstKey - 7200).\r\nThese conditions could never happen at the same time because nTimeFirstKey <=\r\nnLowestTimestamp.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to make a more substantial API improvement in the future (making\r\nScanForWalletTransactions private and exposing a higher level rescan method to\r\nRPC code), but @TheBlueMatt pointed out this odd behavior\r\nintroduced by #9773 yesterday, so I'm following up now to get rid of badness\r\nintroduced by that merge.",
