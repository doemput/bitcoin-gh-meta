I believe in the case above, at least, this would have worked.\r\n\r\nEdit2: prevector calls malloc/realloc directly. So we'd either need to switch to new[] there, or call std::get_new_handler() directly.",

OK, so now in CCoinsViewDB::BatchWrite we iterate over the entries in mapCoins, allocating memory for each one in the leveldb batch, erasing *AS WE GO*...at some point it ran out of memory, throwing bad_alloc and leaving pcoinsTip in an inconsistent state, but std::bad_alloc is not an std::runtime_error so the catch at the end of FlushStateToDisk didnt catch it. OK, phew, so now we go to connect the next block and fail to connect its inputs (without allocating new disk space). I /think/ that explains your debug.log without hand waving about hardware errors",
