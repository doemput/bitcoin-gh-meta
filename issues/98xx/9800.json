   "body" : "I am setting up a node and I notice that the initial sync is slow and I am not fully using my CPU nor my bandwidth. (CPU load averages in 50% and Bandwidth averages 40Mbps out of 300Mbps available).\r\n\r\nI believe that when a node is doing the first blockchain syncing it needs more outbound connections, for example, 16.\r\n\r\nTo avoid using too many peers and too many resources I propose only increasing  MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS to 16 temporarily when the node is doing its initial syncing and only if port 8333 is open and accepting connections (to encourage nodes to be reachable).\r\n\r\nThis would not harm the network as it would only be during the initial syncing and It would speed up it while encouraging owners to accept incoming connections.\r\n\r\n",
