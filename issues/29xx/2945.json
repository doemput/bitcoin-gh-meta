The maximum credit is limited so that\r\n users don't lose the disincentive to stuff random data in their\r\n transactions, the limit of 109 is based on the size of a P2SH\r\n redemption with a compressed public key.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't need a staged deployment because the priority is not\r\n used as a relay criteria, only a mining criteria.",
