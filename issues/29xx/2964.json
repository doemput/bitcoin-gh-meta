Summary of the changes:\r\n* Use `getheaders` instead of `getblocks` based synchronization, so that the best block in the chain is always known before actually downloading it. No more orphan blocks, ever.\r\n* Use a moving-window based block downloading mechanism (the heuristics are simple and behave badly for very small blocks, but except for the very beginning of the chain, it works very well).\r\n* Allow blocks to be stored out-of-order in the block database files.\r\n* Reorganize the block connection logic significantly.\r\n* Add a `getblockheader` RPC command.",
