   "body" : "During the startup of Bitcoin-qt on Windows, (which is extremely slow, usually taking several minutes to start), the standard taskbar icon for the running program does not display, making it impossible to ALT-TAB back to the Bitcoin program's startup dialog until the several-minute startup process completes.  In other words, Bitcoin-qt basically disappears the moment you switch to another window.\r\n\r\nIt should be trivial to toggle a flag on the startup window created to make it show up on the taskbar.  I haven't programmed Win32 in a while but I know it was basically a checkbox in Visual Studio last time I did it.\r\n\r\nTest system: Windows XP SP3 32-bit, all updates, Bitcoin-qt 0.8.5, 7200 RPM hard drive, 4GB RAM, Core i5 760 quad core at 4.0GHz",
