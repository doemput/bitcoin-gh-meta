Consider the scenario where a user gets a loan, and saves the repayment address in his address book for later. I would consider it a bug if he got a warning when he tried to send to it the first time. So some explicit flag is needed (it can be set on the address book entry went it is used for sending).\r\n3. \"Address reuse is not recommended!\" is too soft and unclear. I suggest \"You have already paid this address!\", and making it a hard error with a manual override (dialog with an \"Ignore and send anyway\" option?)",

This way would make it easier, I think, to add whether or not the address is used to the address book view as well (just a few lines would need to be added). I hope to update the address book view to be search-able and filterable in the near future and being able to show only unused / used addresses would be a useful filtering option.\r\n\r\nThe loop looking up destdata and the loop I wrote to lookup the used value are basically identical with the destdata loop being slightly more complicated but probably no real performance difference. I can change it still though of course if I am missing something that makes the way I did it worse. Thanks!",
