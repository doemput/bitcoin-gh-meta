This has not yet become a huge threat for Bitcoin, but it will because by nature, Bitcoin is easy to steal. In fact Bitcoin might even become the primary target of the whole botnet market: Without Bitcoin, to earn money you needed to find someone shady to buy all the computing power which you were stealing with your malware - probably rather difficult to find someone who pays for something this illegal. Now you can monetize directly by stealing Bitcoins and using the machines for mining. Bitcoin is as promising for malware authors as it is for honorable use :(\r\nAnd deterministic wallets are the foundation for watch-only / paper wallets, so they will help security very much. Therefore, if I'm allowed to I would also vote for this being high priority.",

But anyone who wants to go for secure long-term storage of coins will *not* decide to use a non-popular, third-party software. The official / first / most popular / primary implementation and because of its most users most tested software usually is usually the choice of people who want to go down the secure path.\r\n\r\nAnd with Bitcoin, security is something which has much higher demand than with other software, so its even more important to have a nice primary implementation.",

If I want the most rock-solid, stable experience, why on earth would I decide not to go for the most widespread, seeming-to-be-official version of each? It's impossible to randomly determine for 3000 packages whether a third party re-implementation is deemed to be more stable.\r\n\r\nPlease don't give up providing a trustworthy reference implementation.\r\nAFAIK, there isn't even a Bitcoin wallet with deterministic builds other than Bitcoin core yet.\r\nThe only other thing which people say to be high security is Bitcoin Armory, and **for over 1 year** they failed to process my bug report about their source code compilation instructions providing **completely broken GnuPG validation**\r\nhttps://github.com/etotheipi/BitcoinArmory/issues/91\r\n(the issue *still* applies: https://bitcoinarmory.com/building-from-source/)\r\n\r\nYou're still the best :)",
