There are a LOT of simpler privacy changes that can be made in Bitcoin-Qt before this, that would work for everyone all the time with no dependence on \"just in time\" rendezvous. For instance, deterministic wallet support and a more scalable wallet would make it much easier for people to avoid re-using addresses. Improving the way the payment protocol is used, to fragment coins and transfer payments in several transactions, also obfuscates the block chain probably at lower cost in terms of complexity.",

The nice thing about coin fragmentation is that (beyond it having fewer moving pieces), it avoids outputs ever being linked in the first place.\r\n\r\nConsider a business that pays its employees a salary at the end of the month. To do this it builds a giant transaction that pays to the employees address. The employees wallet may well try to perform a coinjoin on this output to disguise the fact that it came from Joe's Coffee House, but unless there happen to be a huge number of users online simultaneously waiting to do a CoinJoin with big inputs, it's very likely to result in a failed mix (can guess the output from the input). Also, the user would still end up with a huge salary-sized output, leaking a lower bound of their balance.\r\n\r\nIf the employee submits a PaymentRequest with a few hundred requested outputs, the business can give back transactions that satisfy those outputs with the minimum linkage possible - there's no way to know the transactions are related, especially if the employee chooses to broadcast them smeared over a period of time. The anonymity set is the entire set of Bitcoin users instead of the small number who took part in the coinjoin.\r\n\r\nNow that said, CoinJoins have their place, but it seems to me like there's a lot of lower hanging fruit to harvest first.",

Of course that only works if you trust the sender not to double spend - it'd require some kind of risk analysis. Like, broadcasting your salary this way is not likely to be an issue. Broadcasting a payment from someone who just walked into a supermarket, not a great idea.\r\n\r\nSuch behaviour would already require a queue with a notion of how OK it is delay payments, but on the recipient side.\r\n\r\nI don't think fees would change anything. People already have an incentive to keep their private lives private, and doing a coinjoin is not expensive. The main reason I was thinking of why most people might not be online is these days a lot of people's primary computing devices are battery powered and sync to the network only occasionally, and only for a few minutes. It's probably possible to set things up so wallets get woken up to take part from time to time, but this is an additional pile of complexity that wouldn't make much sense in Bitcoin-Qt anyway, given its current state.",

In the default case, it's ok if the transaction doesn't always wind up being joined. Equally, we may be able to take advantage of a fee UI's - if user's are taking advantage of time/cost trade-offs anyway integrate that configurable timeout as part of the CoinJoin process, which in turn helps the users who want a transaction sent quicker.",

Is there a pull request or requests that relates to this, if so, can someone provide a direct link?  I'm kind of assuming that if this were implemented, concerns about possible redlisting would not be an issue due to that the software would provide users with a way around or out of that (censorship, etc.) type of problem, and at the very least it would provide a meaningful response to state-actor ban proposals such as those out of Russian Federation. Regarding the earlier comment by @shahnah ~ why is this not a higher priority?  I feel that it should be.",

It has yielded / spun off repositories that can be used readily by other projects such as [this one](https://github.com/darkwallet/stealth.js).\r\n\r\nI know that there have also been concerns about the discoverability of users under CoinJoin, and there is an [extensive discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0) about different ideas that go beyond the original CoinJoin proposal. These include, but are not limited to, [ideas relating to ring signatures](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.msg8719573#msg8719573), as well as [Coinshuffle](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.msg9042932#msg9042932) which I am unfamiliar with, and @gmaxwell / Poelstra's [Output Distribution Obfuscation](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/brs-arbitrary-output-sizes.txt) ideas (which interest me a lot).\r\n\r\nThen there is the issue of funding.  The fund which is specified for CoinJoin and similar or related privacy proposals [is well stocked](http://blockchain.info/address/3M8XGFBKwkf7miBzpkU3x2DoWwAVrD1mhk), with currently over 42 BTC available to fund such privacy tasks.  This [has been discussed in bitcoin-development previously some months back](http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/32473798/).  It would be good to see if there are some proposals which the maintainers of that fund have identified as reasonable candidates to receive such funding, and if anyone knows of such please indicate what they are.  If core developers / maintainers are working towards a technically better / easier to use proposal or proposals that could be incorporated directly into bitcoin or made available through any wallet, it would be good to hear of what that is, particularly in light of developments in the Russian Federation, UNSC, and beyond.  Where there is a way to protect users in a manner that clearly addresses the issues of discoverability and linkability, it would certainly be good to see it integrated directly into bitcoin, available in Core and made easy for various wallet developers to incorporate as well.

To put it another way, one could add CoinShuffle to JoinMarket, at the cost of quite a bit of extra complexity, and there would be significant benefit, but it would not solve *that* problem. Solutions I believe are more along the lines of what's [here](https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/9cbba5e9408d23813ca8)\r\n\r\nEdit: amplification, from the Coinshuffle paper: \"Overview of CoinShuffle: First, the participants **announce their input addresses**...\"",

Your reply links to \"link collections\" and always when I tried to reply I got lost in the tenth link or so but I'm pretty sure there is no real big misunderstanding on my part. JoinMarket is fighting the good fight and does consider using CoinShuffle, too, and Daniel Krawisz [implementing it](https://github.com/DanielKrawisz/shuffle-java) as open source, can only help with that. And with CS implemented and not having a \"market\" to get transactions that are wanted, we might need JM again but I don't think that this is the case. Paying makers to mix, is in my opinion counterproductive to get honest makers and therefore I hope to avoid makers all together.\r\n\r\n> Our current concept is to have mixing accounts, where Mycelium would on auto-pilote shuffle coins to the desired degree of mixing and warn the user if he wanted to spend insufficiently mixed coins, preferably making this a default behavior for new HD accounts (but to spend mining fees for our users by default is really a tricky thing. But CS could have its fees sponsored but that's details for later)",

But anyway, yes, ABISprotocol's statement is definitely wrong; more to the point, it's easy to verify for oneself by simply running a joinmarket bot; you can do a coinjoin any time, usually anything up to 10 btc can easily be done with say 5-10 counterparties, immediately. (Up to 100 is also possible, but liquidity is much less).\r\n\r\n@Giszmo I've answered on reddit, but I think the point I was making here stands; Coinshuffle doesn't address the fact that you need to announce input addresses.

Mixing only makes sense when\r\n\r\n* no player has an incentive to be all counter-parties in a mix (makers get paid)\r\n* no player can track the matching (taker knows the matching)\r\n\r\n@ABISprotocol so technically you might claim that my solution (mix coins in a CoinShuffle account inside the wallet, then spend as normal transaction from there) is no coinjoin because the payment isn't coinjoin? I would see that way more nuanced: Having a shuffling account would allow us to add trickling payments, where low priority payments can be made using shuffling, paying in increments to a BIP47 address. I would love to get my salary this way. It would only be a question of the contract giving this flexibility but then, why not have a payment every other day in varying amounts?\r\n\r\nBut yes, to do a privacy enhancing coinjoin transaction for an ad-hoc payment, something like JoinMarket would still be needed. At least until CTs are implemented in Bitcoin, at which point coinshuffle could be enhanced for ad-hoc payments and joinmarket wouldn't be needed anymore.",

According to your bullet points, you're making the argument that because there is a financial incentive to take part, large scale sybil-to-spy is likely, but it's a weird argument. No large spying organisation would be motivated by small coinjoin fees anyway (and indeed would choose very small/zero/negative fees). So effectively you're saying that the absence of a market incentive would makes sybil less likely - but that's just sybiling to make money, and is a problem that needs to be addressed with some kind of commitments; it's got nothing to do with Coinshuffle.",

      "body" : "@Giszmo CoinShuffle is not the same thing as CoinJoin.  [CoinShuffle](http://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/) is based on the idea of CoinJoin but is different.  From the CoinShuffle original paper, \"CoinShuffle is inspired by CoinJoin to ensure security against theft and by the accountable anonymous group communication protocol Dissent to ensure anonymity as well as robustness against DoS attacks.\" However, CoinShuffle is _not_ the same as CoinJoin.  Joinmarket, on the other hand, is a \"CoinJoin implementation with incentive structure to convince people to take part.\"\r\n\r\nThe original CoinJoin was published here, bounty was claimed in same message:\r\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.msg3016952#msg3016952\r\nWhat appeared to have evolved from that is\r\nhttps://github.com/darkwallet/coinjoin.js\r\nand https://darkwallet.github.io/coinjoin.js/\r\n\r\n(Edit:  A DW \"best-practices\" document was published, which included references to CoinJoin, that can be seen here: https://wiki.unsystem.net/en/index.php/DarkWallet/Best_practices#CoinJoin)\r\n\r\nPlease correct if I am wrong here, but I am thinking that CoinShuffle is not considered a CoinJoin implementation, but something that is similar to it.  A final consideration to add in this comment is that the [CoinShuffle developers state on their page](http://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/) that \"The (CoinShuffle) implementation is not at all developed with security in mind. It has been written purely to evaluate the feasibility and performance of CoinShuffle and is INSECURE.  DO NOT USE THIS WITH YOUR COINS.\"",

The GUI might show an odd double spend attempt but the coinjoin tx will win because the non-coinjoin was never broadcast.\r\n\r\nOf course you can send coinjoins from your Bitcoin Core wallet today by using the joinmarket sendpayment.py script with the --rpcwallet flag, which gets UTXOs, a change address and private keys through json-rpc and uses them to create a coinjoin. However it's a command line app which only developers can love.",
