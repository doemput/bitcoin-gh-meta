      "body" : "All the reports in this ticket look like C++ runtime library mismatches. With the release of OS X Mavericks, Apple removed all GCC compilers (there's a g++ symlink, but it points to clang++) and switched clang++'s default C++ runtime to libc++.\r\n\r\nYou will get these problems when trying to link against a library built against a different C++ runtime library than your binary uses Ã¢ÂÂ and the link error is actually a good thing, because the alternative would be hard-to-debug crashes at runtime.\r\n\r\nSo, you need to decide which C++ runtime library to use: Apple's new libc++, or GCC's libstdc++. In my opinion the only sane choice is clear, because Apple will no longer support GCC/libstdc++, and this combination is stuck in a version that's multiple years outdated. Especially if bitcoin wants to use C++11 at some point, the use of libc++ cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\nLong story short: Make sure your boost lib uses the same C++ runtime as bitcoin.\r\n\r\nMacPorts uses the same defaults as Apple's compilers, i.e. libstdc++ on systems below Mavericks, and libc++ on Mavericks and beyond. If you're compiling on Mavericks against MacPorts libraries you don't have to do anything with the autotools-based build system, because your compiler will already default to libc++. Note that this isn't the case if you have the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` environment variable set to anything below 10.9 (because that implicitly switches the compiler's default).\r\n\r\nSo, in conclusion:\r\n - if you're on 10.9 and compile against MacPorts libs, ensure `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is unset. You cannot use the libs from MacPorts to build bitcoin for older systems by setting it.\r\n - if you're on 10.8 and below and compile against MacPorts libs, libstdc++ will be used automatically and you shouldn't have any problems.\r\n - if you use boost or any other dependency from a different source, check which C++ runtime it uses using `otool -L`. If it's libc++ and you're on <= 10.8, you need to compile with `clang++ -stdlib=libc++`. If it's libstdc++ and you're on 10.9 or later, you need to compile with `clang++ -stdlib=libstdc++`.\r\n - if the C++ runtimes used by your dependencies differ, you will have problems.\r\n\r\nFrom a MacPorts POV, there doesn't seem to by anything to fix here?",

You can also make g++ use libc++ using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22228208/using-g-with-libc.

There's nothing wrong here from a bitcoin POV, since this only happens when somebody tries to use the wrong compiler or an incompatible boost.\r\n\r\nIf anything, documentation could be improved to suggest using `CXX=clang++` as argument to `./configure` on OS X. The configure script could also be modified to default to that.\r\n\r\nOf course, somebody could modify `configure.ac` to link a test C++ binary, use `otool -L $binary | grep -E lib(std)?c++` to figure out which C++ runtime is being used and check the boost library to be used for the same runtime Ã¢ÂÂ I'm just not sure that would be a good use of your time.",

So none of things that are related to homebrew in this thread were helpful, but I got some hints that I haven't tried. And actually it is very simple way to try, so better to share it with hoping that someone would solve their problem with an easy action.\r\n\r\nIn the past, some of my libraries were not familiar with clang++ and had to build other gcc ports. And my finding is that what I only need to do is switching back to Apple from GNU. I have three versions available for gcc, which are \"apple-gcc42\", \"llvm-gcc42\", and \"mp-gcc48\" which was in active. By running \"port select --set gcc \"apple-gcc42\", I succeed linking with boost 1.55.0.  ",
