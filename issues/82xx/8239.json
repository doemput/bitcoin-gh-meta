This immediately bootstraps the parallel block fetches that keeps us in sync.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we reindex, we usually have all connection slots already filled by the time the reindex finishes, and we don't go back to ask for headers from existing connections. This usually leads to a wait until the next block is inved.\r\n\r\nThis problem is likely worsed by #7917, as it may now also trigger in cases where the chainstate is behind the blockindex.",
