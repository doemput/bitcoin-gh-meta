You can try re-running the link-line with a \"-v\" added in.\r\n\r\nBut I suspect the linker probably ate all of your memory and died, since you're building natively on arm. You could try adding a large swap partition as a test.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure if aarch64 uses bfd or gold by default. ```ld --version``` would tell you. If it's bfd, you could try forcing gold and seeing if that helps: ```-fuse-ld=gold```.",
