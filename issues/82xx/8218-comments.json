I think the current wallet approaches (Copay, Electrum) to support multiple native USB implementations is bad and what we need is a standard in how wallets-application could interact with hardware wallets.\n\nBIP32 is somehow required, but I could imaging it would also work with importing `n` addresses from a hardware wallet.\n\nIMO Cores wallet should have a mode where all transaction signing is somehow asynchronous and in that more each signature will be requested over an interface (pipe / raw TCP / ZMQ / http [my preferred way]). Each hardware wallet could provide an interface together with an optional UI and other wallets could also use this \"standard communication interface\".\n",
