   "body" : "I found a situation on testnet where a peer could send a header that wouldn't be accepted locally, because of the 2-hour-in-the-future rule.  This would then cause BIP-130 headers sync to fail, because the sender doesn't realize that the recipient didn't accept the header, and so continues to send headers (one-by-one) that build on top of the rejected header, until eventually the sender is disconnected.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to improve upon the situation: if the first header in a received headers message doesn't connect, try once to request connecting headers.\r\n\r\nIf we get two headers messages in a row that don't connect, give up on trying to request connecting headers (to avoid infinite looping with the remote peer), until our peer delivers a headers message that does connect.\r\n\r\nIf this approach is acceptable, I think we should backport to 0.12 (looks like it doesn't merge cleanly, but I can open a new PR for the backport).\r\n\r\ncc: @TheBlueMatt @sipa ",
