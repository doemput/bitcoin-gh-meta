Are you ok with just removing the language about discouraging/encouraging how people use these options, and simply state their existence?\r\n\r\nThen we can see what effect the changes in the 0.13 release have on the network, and reassess whether any recommendations are needed in the first release that actually does a block size increase (through segwit)?",

This means that a low-fee transaction can become more\n+likely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is\n+relayed.\n+\n+With this change, the `-blockminsize` command line option has been removed.\n+\n+The command line option `-blockmaxsize` remains an option to specify the\n+maximum number of serialized bytes in a generated block.  In addition, the new\n+command line option `-blockmaxweight` has been added, which specifies the\n+maximum \"block weight\" of a generated block, as defined by [BIP 141 (Segregated\n+Witness)] (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki).\n+\n+In preparation for Segregated Witness, the mining algorithm has been modified\n+to optimize transaction selection for a given block weight, rather than a given\n+number of serialized bytes in a block.  In this release, transaction selection\n+is unaffected by this distinction (as BIP 141 activation is not supported on\n+mainnet in this release, see above), but in future releases and after BIP 141\n+activation, these calculations would be expected to differ.\n+\n+For optimal runtime performance, miners using this release should specify\n+`-blockmaxweight` on the command line, and not specify `-blockmaxsize`.\n+Additionally (or only) specifying `-blockmaxsize`, or relying on default\n+settings for both, may result in performance degradation, as the logic to\n+support `-blockmaxsize` performs additional computation to ensure that\n+constraint is met.
