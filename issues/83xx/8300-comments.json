This is conceptually trivial to do, but no user friendly method exists as of today. It is easy to get something wrong and lose bitcoins accidentally.

I do have one strange transaction for a bitcoin that was never received from over a year ago, could that be causing some sort of issue? I figured the wallet may have become corrupt, but i have regular backups, so im fairly confident the wallet.dat i have is valid, and from before any of this started.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated ",
