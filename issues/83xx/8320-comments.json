Another version being already sent by email would indeed constitute some discrepancyÃ¢ÂÂ¦\r\n\r\nWell-written release notes may be very useful when upgrading and reference documentation may be useful in other cases Ã¢ÂÂ they are complementary. To summon a reference, [DjangoÃ¢ÂÂs patch review checklist](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/#patch-review-checklist) states that both new features and backwards incompatible changes must have a note in release notes; the former must also have ordinary documentation and tests. Bitcoin apparently has no such policy, as pull request #6148 has neither documentation nor tests, but it may be a pattern worth heading to.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if release notes are generally not amendable and tied to a particular tag, then there is a question why after making a release they are still keeped under version control and moved to the `doc/release-notes` directory. They could be trashed as well.",
