As it applies to all transactions, and in particular not just the ones being rejected under the current `-bytespersigop` policy, we should give users more notice on the proposed change.  (In the worst case, some transactions that are relayed under current policy of 20 bytes per sigop could conceivably see their effective feerates cut by up to 60%.  I'm analyzing some historical data to get a sense of how many transactions would be affected by this policy; current estimate: 0.8%, no stats yet on how much of an effect it has overall on those transactions.)\r\n\r\nMoreover I can imagine that downstream software might want to consider updating their notion of feerate to match what we do here (wallets, block explorers, fee estimators, etc), so we should give people time for that.\r\n\r\nOne nit: putting aside any non-linear optimization issues, there's another slightly suboptimal behavior here in how the mining package selection would work.  If a package is too big to fit into the block using the sigops-inflated size, but would fit using its actual size, then we should add it (as we're sorting based on feerate-using-inflated size, it's clearly the best thing for us to add).  However we're getting rid of the caching of ancestor package actual sizes, so we don't have a good way to do this.  I expect that this is a small enough effect that we don't need to worry about it now, but we should document it for the future.",

Our code was broken, to the extent that both miners and the network would be better off patching their code.\r\n\r\n#7081 outlaws low-size high-sigop transactions, but it does not prevent hard-to-validate transactions or high overall validation cost. Those situations can still be produced by simply stuffing the high-sigops transactions until they are big enough to pass. This PR just treats such high-sigop transactions as if they were that big already. As a minor side effect, it removes the incentive for such an attack to in addition to disrupting capacity also bloat the block chain.",

Furthermore, this does not make anything worse: the spam you were trying to prevent in #7081 was never made impossible - just more expensive. This PR does not change that.\r\n\r\n#8364 however makes a related attack **worse**. With that you can have a low-accurate-sigop high-consensus-sigop small-size transaction attack that removes network capacity for an even lower price, as you only need to pay proportional to the accurate sigop count.",

But first, they have no real incentive to do so if the end result is still the same fee.  Plus, an actual attacker has zero incentive to reduce the bloat as a result of this PR either way.  This still ignores the point that none of the spam or attacks should be getting mined anyway.

There should be no fee high enough for accepting a spam/attack transaction.\r\n\r\nNACK as this stands.

It's not really about getting your transaction relayed but about having miners construct more optimal blocks.  It seems silly to me to have the mining code be purposefully less good just because users aren't expecting miners to have more intelligent algorithms.  How do you defend that decision to miners?  We're not giving you better code because some users might be confused and not estimate their fees properly (including Bitcoin Core for that matter)?  Maybe you could make that argument if there was a huge impact, but sounds like its not?\r\n\r\n",
