As an example, #8493 puts the check in libconsensus without putting chain.o in libconsensus too. Whether blocks eventually become valid when violating this rule or not, I think the question that should be asked is \"in a hypothetical finished libconsensus, is this check included or not?\", and I also think the answer is yes.",
