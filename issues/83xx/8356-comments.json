We want to change this number as infrequently as possible.   It doesn't need to change from it's current value right now I don't think, but we don't want it to accidentally change if people adjust minRelayFee.\r\n2) The minimum output created by Bitcoin Core should be higher than the current isDust check.  I would suggest using some maximum of say 2x or 4x the isDust check (at it's current level) and a check using a fee rate from estimatefee, as you do here, but I'd use estimateFee(25) at least, and consider a higher target when we have the ability to do so.\r\n\r\n",

They should be separate limits.  So if we do bump minRelayFee by 5x, isDust doesn't actually change at all, unless we intentionally change it.  And we can intentionally make sure it stays below whatever the min output value we have used in the past couple releases is.\r\n\r\nUsing minimum mempool fee or fee estimation is a mistake.  Both those things are completely volatile on a newly started node.   And even estimatefee(25) can shoot up high temporarily under network load, but shouldn't cause you to  adjust minimum output values unless its a more permanent shift.   I think longer term more stable fee estimates will eventually be possible, but we don't have them now.\r\n\r\n",
