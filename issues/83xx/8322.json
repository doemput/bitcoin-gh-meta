   "body" : "I am unable to open my Bitcoin Core application. I just downloaded it and when it finished installing, the application opened up just fine. After Bitcoin Core was syncing with the network, I got a error message. The application closed out and when I tried opening it up again, it won't. The application first starts up by verifying blocks and once completed, it says \"Activating best chain...\" then the error message appears saying, \"A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details\". The application force itself close from there. Please help! \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[debug log.docx](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/355405/debug.log.docx)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
