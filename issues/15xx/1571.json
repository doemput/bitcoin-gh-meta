   "body" : "This pull is intended to prepare the optionsdialog for further changes to the proxy options and includes a few changes that would bloat a proxy options pull.\n\n- remove duplicate includes, that are already present in ui_optionsdialog.h\n- change QIntValidator to not allow 0 as port-number\n- re-order some function calls to match the Ui element order, for better readbility and to prepare for the addition of further IPv6 and Tor proxy options\n- restat warning for the language selection is only shown, when the\n  language was changed (not on simply activating the Ui element)\n- modify proxy warning message \"This setting...\" into \"Proxy settings...\"\n- split check for object == ui->proxyIp into seperate if-clause\n- unify used format for comments in the code\n-  introduce handleProxyIpValid() function, which handles UI elements and the save button states for valid/invalid\nproxy IPs\n\nThis is what I intend to do with the proxy options (not included here):\n![planned proxy options](http://i45.tinypic.com/5a5ef9.png)",
