   "body" : "This builds on #1525 (the framework for smoothly rolling out new chain/transaction rules), defining \"nVersion=2\" blocks that include the block height as the first bytes of their coinbase.\n\nPutting the height in the coinbase is desired for at least two reasons:\n1. It guarantees that every subsequent block and transaction hash is unique.\n2. It can be used to better reason about plausible difficulty for not-yet-connected blocks.\n\nThe format of the height is \"serialized CScript\" -- first byte is number of bytes in the number (will be 0x03 on main net for the next 300 or so years), following bytes are little-endian representation of the number.\n\nOnly blocks with nVersion=2 are expected to have the height as the first bytes, and the \"must have the height in the coinbase\" rule is only enforced if nVersion=2 blocks are a super-majority (75% of last 1,000 blocks on main network) of the block's immediate ancestors.\n\nThis pull also contains a rule to REJECT nVersion=1 blocks once 95% of hashing power is producing nVersion=2 blocks.  That means the last 5% of hashing power who refuse to upgrade will get orphaned.\n\nAll of this won't affect users/merchants at all, they will happily accept nVersion=1 or nVersion=2 blocks.\n\nI tested this with a testnet-in-a-box setup, creating a 100-block-long nVersion=2 chain and then making sure that:\n1. nVersion=1 blocks were accepted\n2. nVersion=2 blocks that included the wrong block height were rejected (I hacked a bitcoind to test that).\n\n",
