On those platforms such cleanup is only done for threads that are started with boost::thread unless boost::on_thread_exit() is called manually from that thread.\"\nThus the lockstack object in sync.cpp may never be deleted.  This is only really an issue due to recent RPC changes where long-running nodes may have seen many, many RPC threads.",
