      "body" : "@paveljanik Thanks for the feedback. I can certainly merge block2 and block together, if this is what most people want. In an older version I had historical block upload logged, and this generated a lot of output, so block2 was created mostly for this. Currently that logging is disabled entirely which makes block2 less necessary, so perhaps it can be gone already. I'll review the code now, but I think yes block2 debug can be disabled - although I do prefer to give people options, hence leaving it in. If people don't want it, they don't need to enable it.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier version I would show timings, i.e. how long the delay between requesting headers/blocks and them being received was - this was useful to refining timeout code and identifying when download was stalled to a far better degree than the current code. i.e. it would determine within 10 seconds with high reliably when a node had stalled rather than the current 2 minutes. (it did this by monitoring the partial download and actively keeping track of typical delay times).",

People might also ask for the debug of block uploads, but since this wasn't in the code before this pull I felt it was reasonable to leave it still out (and  find a better way to log it more concisely for a future pull request).",
