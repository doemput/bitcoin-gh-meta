Currently if you have a service that processes bitcoin payments, you just need to run a loop (pseudo code):\r\n\r\n```\r\nlastHash = null\r\nwhile (true ) {\r\n   transactions, lastHash = bitcoin-cli listsinceblock $lastHash 6\r\n   for transaction in transactions {\r\n        if transaction.category == \"receive\" {\r\n          if transaction.confirmations == 0 {\r\n               // new mempool entry, notify the user or something\r\n          }\r\n          if transaction.confirmations > 0 {\r\n             //  new confirmed transaction, add it\r\n          }\r\n          if transaction.confirmations < 0 {\r\n            // shit, we've been double-spent. make sure to handle this!\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you change the behavior to filter out the conflicted transactions -- you will silently break peoples (including my) logic for knowing when they've been double-spent against. This is especially important now with bip125",
