   "body" : "## The second param of listsinceblock\n\nFrom [issue 8752](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8752#issuecomment-247988691)\n\n> The second parameter (target confirmation) is quite strange and should probably be better > documented in the RPC help of listsinceblock (check original comment: #199 (comment))\n\nFrom the actual docs here is it is:\n\n> target-confirmations:    (numeric, optional) The confirmations required, must be 1 or more\n\nHowever, that's misleading at best. I've seen at least one project thinking that `target-confirmations` means \"filter to only show transactions of n target-confirmations\". It's a weird param but I'd document it as\n\n> target-confirmations: (numeric, optional) Return the hash of the block that has target-confirmations of confirmations, for use in a further call to listsinceblock\n## Transactions confirmations\n\nSays:\n\n> \"confirmations\": n,       (numeric) The number of confirmations for the transaction. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.\n\nIt should also say when it's < 0, it means the transaction conflicted that many blocks ago\n## bip125-replaceable\n\nThere's an undocumented field of transactions \"bip125-replaceable\" which I believe has three possibilities \"yes\" \"no\" and \"unknown\"  (under what circumstances it says unknown, should also be documented)\n",
