This might also even want to be the default behaviour since during IBD most TXs appear to be orphans, and are routinely dropped (for example when a node disconnects). Therefore, this can waste a lot of bandwidth.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, another pull could be written to stop relaying of TXs to nodes that are clearly far behind the latest block and are running a node that doesn't store many orphan TXs, such as recent versions of Bitcoin Core.",
