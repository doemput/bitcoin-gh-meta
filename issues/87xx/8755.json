   "body" : "This implements a static estimation of sighash size for a transaction. A transaction with more than 90bytes of sighash per weight is non-standard. This is equivalent to 36MB for an 100kB non-segwit transaction, or 360MB for a block in the worst case. All transactions below 100kB with legitimate use of CHECK(MULTI)SIG should remain standard with this limit.\n\nThe estimation of sighash is based on the following 3 assumptions:\n a. OP_CODESEPARATOR and FindAndDelete are disabled by SCRIPT_VERIFY_CONST_SCRIPTCODE. This ensures that the scriptCode serialized in SignatureHash is always the same as the original script passing to the EvalScript. (part of this PR)\n b. SignatureHash is performed once only for each SIGHASH type. (#8654)\n c. Only 6 sighash types are allowed: ALL, NONE, SINGLE, and combinations with ANYONECANPAY (already enforced as policy with STRICTENC)\n\nTodo: unit tests\n",
