   "body" : "Apparently the way lambda's were being used in the first test done by p2p-compactblocks.py was busted, which was masking several bugs in the test.\r\n\r\nSo I redid it a different way that seems to work correctly (I verified that passing in negated predicates causes test failure, which wasn't the case before), and fixed a few other bugs that came up:\r\n\r\n - sendcmpct messages need to be synchronized with RPC calls to generate()\r\n - headers must be synced in order for bitcoind to announce compact blocks\r\n - The last sendcmpct test omitted sending a sendcmpct message (so the test shouldn't have been passing as it was written).\r\n\r\nI think this should be tagged for backport.",
