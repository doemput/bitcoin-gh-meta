   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\n\r\nTesting in bitcoin 0.13.0, calling `bitcoin-cli listsinceblock x` is outputting all double-spent transactions that are in the wallet, even those that were double-spent well and truly before x.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is the issue reproducible?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n#### List steps to reproduce below:\r\n1.   Create a double-spend send to your wallet (easiest using bip125)\r\n2.   Wait until one confirms, and then wait a few more blocks\r\n3.   Run `bitcoin-cli listsinceblock $(bitcoin-cli getbestblockhash)` and it will output the double spent transaction\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe double-spent transaction that was conflicted before the block hash should be filtered",
