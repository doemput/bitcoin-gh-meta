   "body" : "Fee estimation uses a threshold for the fraction of recent transactions of a given fee rate that must have been confirmed within the target number of blocks in order for that fee rate to be considered high enough such that a new transaction with that fee rate will be likely to be confirmed within the target.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the threshold to 95% (from 85%) for all targets other than 1 block.\r\n\r\n85% was previously used because higher thresholds were too hard to meet for a target of 1. However the recent stress test has shown that 85% is not conservative enough, so a target of 1 is special cased and a higher threshold is used. This is a simple change that is meant to be backported to 0.11. Further improvements for fee estimation will hopefully be possible for 0.12.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  Please note that this will in general cause higher fee estimates to be returned.",
