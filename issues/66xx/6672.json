The modifications are explained in #6625. Although the #6526 has an extensive description, I will summarize its general purpose here.\r\nThe goal is to prepare the consensus code for an eventual block size hardfork and also for previous testing. It should simplify other PRs like #6382 (that introduces ```std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max()``` testnet chains to test different block sizes), #6451 (BIP102) or any other block-size-related proposal.\r\n\r\nThe next commit is taken from #6009, which separates GetMedianTimePast() from CBlockIndex and moves it to consensus (it's done in the same commit instead of the next one because it's \"cheaper diff-wise\"). GetMedianTimePast() is needed for verifying block headers, but chain.o will not.\r\n\r\nThe next commit is the code movement. All consensus critical functions that are not separated already (like 4 of the 5 functions in pow.o [the other one can be separated out]) in build-separable files are moved. If you think any of the moved functions are not consensus critical or that there's some missing functions, please, say so. One exception is main::ConnectBlock() which is consensus critical but contains other things that are not welcomed in libconsensus. A VerifyBlock library-safe function can be extracted from it later. #6051 was a similar movement.\r\n\r\nThe last commit is taken from  #6591 (previously #6024). This one has 2 purposes:\r\n\r\n1) Remove chainparams.h and timedata.h dependencies (which are not library-friendly) from consensus.o \r\n2) It's part of a bigger process (see #5970 ) to eventually be able to remove the pCurrentParams global (hidden behind ```Params()```, but still a global). I hope I don't need to explain here why removing globals is a desirable thing...\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
