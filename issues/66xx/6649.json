   "body" : "This allows for much finer control of the transaction fees per kilobyte\r\nas it prevent small transactions using a fee that is more appropriate\r\nfor one that is of a kilobyte.\r\n\r\nThis also allows controlling the fee per kilobyte over rpc such that:\r\n\r\n```bitcoin-cli settxfee `bitcoin-cli estimatefee 2` ```\r\n\r\nwould make sense, while currently it grossly fails often by a factor of x3\r\n\r\nThis fixes issue #6479, and has minimal impact as dynamic fees are currently the default. This default can be overriden in the qt wallet, although I have trouble imagining where that is useful. Possibly the entire concept of fPayAtLeastCustomFee can be removed in a later version.",
