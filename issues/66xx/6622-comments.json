If they have a transfer cap, then it is most likely tied to a monthly billing cycle, so MB/month is likely better. (For example, I think Comcast in the US has a 250GB/month cap, so a Comcast customer might like to allow 100GB/month, or something like that.)",

Will fix it.\r\n\r\nNot sure about limit per month or per day.\r\nPer month can be difficult because not every month has the same amount of days (30/31/27/28). Also it's unclear how one could get \"in sync\" with providers month rhythm (must not be first to last day of month). Though, it still would allow to use a daily measurement cycle (break down the month limit to days, keep focus on a day limit).\r\n\r\nFor now i think keep the day-limit does make things more easy and controllable.",

Then the whole network might blow through its cap in a few days at the start of the month, and be unwilling to serve blocks for the rest of the month!   The daily limit (especially with the arbitrary start point) is less of an issue.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr Your phone call issue is largely orthogonal to what this is addressing.   Good behavior with respect to buffer bloat and general rate restriction are another matter from overall usage.  Those need to be address too, but in other PRs. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The other patch we're discussing on the XT repository solves the problem of inference with consumer services at home due to saturating the limited uplink bandwidth._\r\n\r\nBecause it seems to me that these are two independent problems that are both being called 'throttling', and the two approaches can actually be combined, or rather, would not interfere if both were implemented as-is.\r\n\r\nTor has a hibernate mode that this sounds very similar to. The way it works is essentially shutting down your node when you go over the transfer quota. Similarly, this patch is equivalent to shutting down part of the node when quota is exhausted, i.e. the part that provides useful services to other peers.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth separating the two terms. We could call this one hibernation, and the other patch throttling, as that'd align terminology with Tor and \"throttling\" in network engineering normally means restricting the instantaneous bandwidth usage rather than disconnecting after reaching a daily quota.",
