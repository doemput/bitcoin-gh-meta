      "body" : "> The reason I broke off mempool policy separately...\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to start CPolicy and CDefaultPolicy like in #6423 , but just with the GetMinRelayFeeRate() method instead of ApproveTx [ from IsStandardTx ] and ApproveTxInputs [from  AreInputsStandard ]. And doing it in policy/policy, no need to have two separate files and classes.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming this minRelayFee will remain static for use in CDefaultPolicy::ApproveTx() and dust checks (/me remembers #5114, https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/dc1b96d368d471ea5242ca021148f9f900f69661 , https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/5f519c281c353b0bba8ed06421bf4b5b39b5ebbb and a long, etc, and sighs...).\r\n\r\nIf it's something planned to be dynamic I believe the estimator would be a better place.\r\n\r\nI would also maintain the previously mentioned feature of making it easy for the GUI layer to dynamically create forms to configure all the policy options. I assume you removed the parameter in InitFromArgs() because you didn't knew what was about.\r\n\r\n> To answer your last question I was assuming both CTxMemPool and CBlockPolicyEstimator would depend on MempoolPolicy which would not depend on either of them.\r\n\r\nIIRC you previously wanted the policy to depend on CTxMemPool. Great, this is much closer to what I want.\r\nIt is important to make clear that this is completely a choice, nothing strictly needs to depend on anything else.\r\n\r\nMy ideal choice would be:\r\n\r\nMy preference is that CDefaultPolicy extends CBlockPolicyEstimator (see https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/f64df9fcb210f43302c0d1242bf2fa221a77bd32 ), that is between the 2 they fully implement the CPolicy interface, but CBlockPolicyEstimator is, in principle, an abstract class as it doesn't implement all the pure virtual methods in CPolicy.\r\n\r\nNeither CBlockPolicyEstimator nor CDefaultPolicy would depend on CTxMempool, but CTxMempool would initially depend on the CPolicy interface.\r\n\r\nThen decouple  CTxMempool from CPolicy (see #7145 ).\r\n\r\nThat way implementors of alternatives to CDefaultPolicy don't need to know or touch CTxMempool's internals to implement their own policies.\r\nIf I remember correctly, you were very skeptical of this even being possible or being compatible with clean, readable and extensible code, but that's what I'll do for Bitcoin JT (taking things from https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/policy-tip-0.12.99 #7145 and https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/policy-minrelayfee-0.12.99 which are the least-outdated most-complete branches I have on policy) anyway.\r\n\r\nWe really don't need to decide that now, my fear was that you wanted to separate  MempoolPolicy from CPolicy and CDefaultPolicy because you knew I didn't want CDefaultPolicy to depend on CTxMemPool, but maybe I was ok with a separate MempoolPolicy depending on CTxMemPool.\r\nI prefer a single policy interface which takes CTxMemPool as a param to some of its methods (as said this is not necessary and I don't like it), than 2 separated policy interfaces, even if one of them is fully decoupled from CTxMemPool.\r\nAnyway, that question has been answered.\r\nSummary of nits.\r\n\r\n- Maintain param in InitFromArgs()\r\n- Consider using https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/6de4f556884a4e362b20baae165271ce8ce7893f\r\n- Use CPolicy and CDefaultPolicy instead of MempoolPolicy and do it in policy/policy.o and policy/interface.h like in #6068\r\n- There's no need for setters beyond InitFromArgs(). CPolicy should be passed as a const ref to most functions that need it anyway (analogous to ```const CChainParams& chainparams```).\r\n ",
