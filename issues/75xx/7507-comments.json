Its really trivial to go git clone some CPU miner and point it to bitcoind...we dont need an entirely-unmaintained CPU miner in the codebase when we have a separate (?!) codepath for mining on regtest.

This holds up a (precious) RPC thread instead of a dedicated mining thread. With a timeout (or \"max iter count\") it would certainly be acceptable to me though.~~\r\n\r\n~~But as you would effectively still need an external script to mine testnet, to keep calling `generate` after every timeout, instead of just `pass -gen=1 and forget`. I'm not convinced that this is better than a completely external reference miner.  Easier to implement, sure.~~\r\n\r\nEdit: I've talked with @sipa on IRC and he convinced me that this is the way to go. Our 'reference miner' (for testnet) will just be a python script that calls `generate` in a loop.",
