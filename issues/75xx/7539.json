   "body" : "This is a small refactor to how we use the boost multi_index in `CTxMemPool` -- rather than have to use fixed index numbers in our code, I added some tags so that we can use logical names instead, so that e.g. `nth_index<2>` becomes `index<entry_time>`.\r\n\r\nThis was motivated by me rebasing some old work on to master, and I realized that the usage of fixed indices was error prone.\r\n\r\nI didn't bother with a tag name for the zero-th index (txid), since nothing seems to explicitly use it, but I can add one if people think that'd be better.",
