      "body" : "Thanks for the feedback. I agree, testnet-specific behavior should be avoided if at all possible, but the testnet-specific difficulty rules seem to be what is causing the problem. Maybe another solution would be to have the code that resets testnet difficulty after 20 minutes also reset the work value for pindexBestHeader so a new block with less work is able to replace it. I'm not sure where that happens, though, so I haven't been able to test it out.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible my theory isn't exactly correct. Currently, my pindexBestHash is set to a block with a height 2000 below the current tip, but the nChainWork is greater than the current tip. It doesn't show on any block explorers, so maybe it was set to a very high difficulty then orphaned.\r\n\r\nIn theory the same thing could happen on mainnet, but with the amount of mining power out there I can't imagine someone mining an orphaned block that still has more POW than the main chain 2000 blocks later.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
