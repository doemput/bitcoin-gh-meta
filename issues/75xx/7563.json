   "body" : "If we agree that libbitcoinconsensus should not depend on chain.o, we need some other dependency as a requirement.\r\nThis same thing could be done with a \"final\" almost-C-ready API instead of a CPP abstract class (and that was my initial idea), but that would be more disruptive and harder to review.\r\n\r\nNot introducing a non-storage interface for CBlockIndex is blocking the following things:\r\n\r\n- Decouple pow.o from chain.o and move it to the consensus package\r\n- This will allow us to decouple consensus/consensus.cpp from chain.o right away (once #7310 or similar is merged)\r\n- This will allow new consensus code (for example, an implementation of bip9) to avoid depending on CBlockIndex. This will also allow to s/CBlockIndex/CBlockIndexView in small encapsulation commits while minimizing disruption.",
