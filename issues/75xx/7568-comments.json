To be clear, this is the combined (two-sided) alert rate; the one-sided alerts (pHigh or pLow) have individual rates of every ~ 100 years.\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to the original code, which from [simulation](https://gist.github.com/bitcoinfees/0f2203bdced119b98c30), gives an alert rate of ~ 3.5 years.\r\n\r\nAdditional statistics: assuming the block rate deviates from the proof-of-work target by 20% (due to changing hash rate), then pHigh / pLow will have rates of once per 3 / 8 years respectively, which seems reasonable.  If this is deemed too high, the test can be modified to allow for deviations up to a specified amount.\r\n\r\nThe other significant change here is that the test spans are made non-overlapping, and their frequency is reduced from once per 10 minutes to once per 130 minutes. This unfortunately reduces the potential statistical power (the ability to correctly detect an anomaly), and also adds latency to the alerts.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this change is that is not trivial to determine the threshold for overlapping spans. It can be done by simulation, but that's not as a good as the closed-form solution that you would get for non-overlapping spans.",

With the computed threshold and assuming constant hashrate, the fail-high (>=33 blocks in 120 minutes) should trigger for this node every ~100 years.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the only node on the network; and different nodes start at different times, and so they sample on different schedules. So there are more opportunities for the alarm to be falsely triggered somewhere on the network.\r\n\r\nSo if the event we are trying to prevent is \"hashrate is constant and yet an alarm is triggered somewhere on the network\" then this is no better than the original method where each node sampled continuously (because the network as a whole sampled continuously). For the new parameters, I estimate it will trigger every ~18 years (I haven't run simulations yet).\r\n\r\nOn top of that we have the added confusion of some nodes reporting an alarm while others do not.\r\n\r\nIt would make more sense to me if each node tested for the alarm once when it starts, and then on a 4-hour schedule which is the same for all nodes.",
