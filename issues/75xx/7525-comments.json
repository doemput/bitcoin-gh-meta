Keep the node/wallet code separate.\r\n2. Improve the node's performance.\r\n3. Implement SPV support for the node so it works before/while the sync goes in the background.\r\n\r\nThe first two have been improving with every release, but it takes time.

Core's wallet should run on it's own process and communication only over p2p (at the beginning, maybe also over RPC).\r\n2. The wallet should use SPV against the fullnode on localhost and/or SPV against a trusted fullnode on a remote system\r\n3. The GUI should be split into \"node GUI\" and \"wallet GUI\" (maybe to separated applications, or at least two separated code bases [one could be a submodule/subtree of the other]).\r\n\r\n**Point 1** can be realized by adding a runtime- (or even compile) option that allows running the bitcoind in SPV mode (only headers will be loaded, no mempool), most node code is unused in this mode.\r\nBut: the question the might be raised, if having a wallet-only mode (SPV) in bitcoin-core is something we really want to have (or if it should be writing in a new independent repository).\r\n\r\n**Point 2** is challenging. I guess using p2p and RPC at the same time will be hard to configure for a \"non-experienced\" users if the node is running on a remote server. Also privacy is a problem.\r\nIMO the best way would be, to add optional encryption to the p2p layer by ECDH and preshared pub keys (auth) and allow to server some special commands to allowed nodes (your local SPV wallet). Fee estimation and things like that would be required to run a detached, process separated wallet. Also, if we fully would like to decouple the GUI form the node, we could think about commands to control your node over p2p (although, this includes some serious conceptual security risks). Configuring a SSH tunnel for p2p and RPC seems after a really bad user experience (setup hassle) and would probably not allow to use smartphone SPV wallets against your trusted fill node. If we would allow p2p auth & encryption, this would result in a very easy setup (pre-share a ec pubkey between fullnode and spv-node, done).\r\n\r\nOne of the main problem is, touching the bitcoin-cores wallet can introduce new bugs in the wallet code which could result in loosing funds (worst case). Also main bottleneck for wallet changes and reviews.",

Is this just shifting code around without really achieving much towards actual separation? If that is the conclusion, perhaps I can redeem the idea by starting to identify node-specific code and shifting it into a similar  `nodeServiceModules` object? (Suggestions on better naming welcome if we go ahead ...).\r\n\r\nOr perhaps stick with the ENABLE_WALLET checks and start adding in new ENABLE_NODE checks where appropriate?",

Why have 3 copies of the blockchain on a system with three different users each of which has a different bitcoin wallet? In fact you can't because they can't run at the same time unless from different VMs.\r\n\r\nAlso, the reason I don't run a bitcoin client on my laptop is because 60 GB is too much, maybe for some people buying a bigger drive is not a problem but for some of us, we don't have the same financial resources available so we don't replace hardware until it fails.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could use the blockchain on my desktop from my laptop - with the Qt client - specifying the IP address.\r\n\r\nThin clients may be beyond the scope of bitcoin-core now but it doesn't have to be.\r\n\r\nEspecially now that many ISPs are implementing bandwidth caps, it makes sense to have bitcoind running on one computer on a LAN that all clients on the LAN can communicate with. Sure you can configure all the other clients to only use the one on the LAN as a source for blocks, and some people do that, but is that any more secure than just having thin clients connect to the one on the LAN?",
