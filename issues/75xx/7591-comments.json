Since pruning is not compatible with -txindex, that gets switched off and then the whole chain has to get re-indexed before it can be pruned.\r\n\r\nWhen 0.12 came out a few days ago, I wondered if updating the checkpoints to 395,000 would make much of a difference. I ran tests with various system configurations. The two competing versions of the software I used were the official 0.12 release and master + the patch to use block 395,000 as the latest checkpoint. The tests were simply to re-index the chain. I used an x86_64 quad core that runs at roughly 2.8 GHz when frequency scaling is in performance mode and a little less (it fluctuates during the test) when in powersave. I tried an unencrypted 5400 rpm sata drive and a samsung 840 pro ssd with luks full disk encryption. 8GB ram with dbcache set to 6000. Between any two competing runs on the same system config, the checkpoint change did NOT make any real difference. And, like Greg said, across the tests, on the order of 4 hours +- half an hour is basically what I got consistently.\r\n\r\nI also started to run tests on some armv7 hard float machines (odroid xu4, c1+, and ras pi 2 -- didn't test a Jetson TK1 yet). But, man those are so much slower (for a number of reasons including storage speed, no assembly optimizations, etc...). It's like 9-15 minutes on my x86_64 configs vs around 1.5-2.5 hours on the various SBC configs for the first 200,000 blocks or so. I didn't even let those tests complete since I just didn't have the time.\r\n\r\nWith the ARM machines in mind, I was thinking of putting a PR forward for block 395,000. If there's any desire for that, I can do it. But, I didn't yet because I just figured that re-indexing on the ARM SBCs is just using the wrong tool for the job. If you can run an x86_64 full node and prune datadir and then copy it to the ARM machine, do that. It's more of a question of if we should try to support the lower power machines for people that don't have the higher power luxury.",

Those alone are a 2x validation speed improvement.\r\n\r\nBut as you say, validating performance on a low end SBC is just not great. It can be papered over by bypassing it, but I think there are better ways to do that (e.g. don't validate in IBD for blocks that are burried by a month of POW) which don't keep sending researchers down blind alleys like static checkpoints do. (The biggest effect of checkpoints these days is their invocation in papers describing centralized consensus systems as justification for a (false) equivalence of their approach and Bitcoin.)\r\n\r\n",

If I benchmarked 0.12 on that and then added the ARM assembly optimizations and ran the same re-indexing benchmark test, would that help you guys move forward with those changes? It would provide a comparison of the speedup, but probably more importantly, it would also show that the speedup does not introduce some chain splitting regression (at least as far as validating the ~400k blocks that have been created so far). I guess the question is, has the slowness of ARM SBC validation hindered your regression testing efforts in a way that my faster board could possibly help?",

This time I got the `LoadExternalBlockFile: Deserialize or I/O error - std::bad_alloc` at 00000000000000000ee1ba35093a736f150a113d0231d50c29b37c3f05d1ae62 height=346233. So it got 9637 blocks farther and the run time was 19 seconds shorter. So, that points to the checkpoint update making some difference, but it's not all that meaningful since at this rate, re-indexing on this class machine is still seemingly futile.\r\n\r\n@rebroad I have a Raspberry Pi 2, and that is a much less powerful computer than this Jetson TK1 ARM SBC config that I'm telling you all about.

      "body" : "@gmaxwell I was studying the current checkpoint implementation in master today and was wondering if they are still validly serving their role with respect to what you mentioned about them \"preventing low difficulty header flooding attacks\".\r\n\r\nWith headers-first IBD, it seems like the checkpoints are avoidable by a dishonest sync node peer. For example, a new node connects to a dishonest sync node that sends only headers that it has computed for a chain that never includes the earliest mainnet checkpoint, block height=11,111 hash=0000000069e244f73d78e8fd29ba2fd2ed618bd6fa2ee92559f542fdb26e7c1d (and therefore any of the other configured checkpoints either). GetLastCheckpoint will never find a checkpoint in mapBlockIndex (because none ever get added -- mapBlockIndex is attacker controlled) and that makes CheckIndexAgainstCheckpoint never fail.\r\n\r\nIs this the kind of DoS that the checkpoints were meant to protect against?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Now that I typed this up a little while ago, it occurs to me that what you probably meant was about general low difficulty blocks/branches being flooded out to all nodes. The checkpoints will protect against that still. That's different than just targeting new IBD nodes that don't have a header chain yet. I was just too focused on the one idea.",

Once a checkpointed header is sync'ed, then all blocks before it will skip signature validation, but before that happens, sig checking is on.\r\n\r\nAs a way to judge progress, the current checkpoints are so out of date that I don't think they serve the purpose well either.\r\n\r\nCheckpoints, as I assumed they worked before I looked at how they actually work, could be used to remove consensus code that is only used to validate blocks buried deep in the chain. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8391 is the reason why I dug into how the checkpoints are actually working. Thus they could be used as a way to cleanup the codebase if implemented differently. PoW purists would probably not like that, but then they probably would not like #8391 either. What do you think?",
