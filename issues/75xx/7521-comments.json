E.g. you pay someone a tiny amount with a 1e-8/byte fee when their mempool isn't full and then their client will continue to beacon forever... and because their own node hasn't and wouldn't mempool the transaction, it's completely clear that they're the origin.",

Newly created transactions will end up there, and are removed after trying to broadcast for a while - or when the user wants to give up on them.\r\n\r\nIt would be better than considering all transactions for rebroadcast. At the least it would give the user explicit control over that.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it doesn't need to block this sensible privacy improvement, but I agree that the rebroadcast logic is still far from optimal.\r\n",
