It might be more reasonable to have an option to \"use local time if and only if the local time server believes that it is in sync\". \r\n\r\nOf course all this ignores that the normal configuration of NTP is completely insecure, easily spoofed, will believe completely implausible information (e.g. that time is a decade before the release of the software), no effort made against sybil resistance, and there are already known incidents of malicious ntp servers in the public NTP pools... but as a default off option, perhaps that is less of a concern.\r\n",

If that's in scope, then possibly a concern that doesn't depend on a buffer overflow etc... would be where that could be used as a trigger for a previously installed trojan that listens where the NTP listener would have been and then does something bad. That's getting a little far fetched, but it's what came to mind.\r\n\r\nI'll have to double check on the performance question and get back to you. I know when I first worked on this about six months ago or so, I did wonder that. We went with it, but I forget if that was just because it was the typical pattern and the code was simple, or if it just did not matter performance-wise.\r\n\r\noff topic: Speaking of performance, I went to prune a current datadir today that had txindex on. Of course that caused me to have to reindex. I ran 0.12 to do that and was done soooo much faster thanks to sipa and your excellent work on libsecp256k1. Thank-you!",

Do we want that inside GetAdjustedTime?\r\n\r\nYes - the preferred way to do this would be to set a global flag in AppInit2, then use that in the time function. Calling the argument parser every time someone asks for the time is not very elegant, at least.\r\n\r\nOr possibly even better: have the option disable the time-offset logic, set the time offset to 0? That'd remove even need to change the `GetAdjustedTime()` function itself.\r\n\r\nNits:\r\n- Add a `DEFAULT_TRUST_SYSTEM_TIME` constant as is done for other options instead of hardcode the default in the help message and GetBoolArg line.",

Right now, if the median offset is more than 70 minutes, the offset is set to zero and a warning is logged if none of the nodes are within five minutes. So, there is some protection against an attack that attempts to change your node's perspective on time a lot. If your node disagrees substantially with every other node, then you get a warning. But you'll continue to exchange transactions and blocks etc... If banning them turns out to be desirable, then a separate PR might be the way to go.",

For example, maybe a company has nodes in more than one geo location and wants to have a closely consistent perspective on time across all of its nodes. Or, maybe that company wants to have a cluster of nodes running on internally controlled time and a cluster running on network adaptive time. Perhaps there are attacker nodes that feed 69 minute time skews to peers based on user agent and those affected user agents don't want to have their ability to follow consensus affected. From a decentralized validation point of view, I don't see why it would be _necessarily_ bad for a node to take a firm position, or have confidence in its own configuration, on what time it thought it was.",

If not, I'll close this and forget about it. No big deal to me either way. Thanks!\r\n",

Perhaps better to just fix in another PR, since it was an existing misbehavior (though more likely to be triggered when the time is cut down to small numbers).",

True, and in that scenario a warning message also gets output when the median goes beyond the acceptable limit.\r\n\r\nMaybe you were working towards the, perhaps more alarming, scenario where there are five nodes at 10 seconds off and then six more claim the well-known default acceptable limit of 4200 seconds.\r\nThat would cause a large effective change in offset with no other warning.\r\nMaybe that could be the basis for another warning message (in a separate PR)?\r\nBasically, the offset is within tolerance, but there might be something going on.\r\nWe'd need to add an option to set the threshold of change to alert that there might be \"something going on\".\r\nThis is different than simply seeing a large range between min and max offset seen because it actually changes our local offset.\r\n\r\nNow that this value no longer a hard-coded constant, a possible mitigation would be to unpredictably pick a value between 0 and 4200 so that attacker nodes would run a higher risk of sending back offsets that are out of bounds.\r\n\r\nAlso, in your scenario, I'm not sure which set of nodes are attacker nodes (or maybe they're two sets of nodes working at cross-purposes).\r\n\r\nFor example, this is what's really on my mind:\r\n\r\nI've been working on a CLTV-based unidirectional payment channel vulnerability assessment and two actual related threats that come to mind from that are:\r\n- miners that want to get fees from time locked transactions by putting them in blocks \"early\" (will be mitigated by BIP113)\r\n- senders that want to claim the channel's reserve value by getting a refund transaction mined before the receiver can spend a transaction allocating value to her\r\n\r\nBoth threats gain advantage by having more nodes accept into their mempool and relay time-locked transactions early.\r\nEven with BIP113, if a sender can get a non-opt-in-RBF sequence value containing transaction propagated early, that inhibits the receiver's ability to even propagate an honest allocation transaction later.\r\n\r\nSo maybe the bad actors set up a bunch of passive nodes that, when connected to, return valid high time offsets.\r\n",
