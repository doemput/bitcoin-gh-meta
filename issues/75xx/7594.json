   "body" : "This implements caching of count, size, (modified) fee, and sigops of each mempool entry with its unconfirmed ancestors.\r\n\r\nThis is in preparation for adding support to `CreateNewBlock` for transaction selection based on fees-with-ancestors, for which I'll open another pull request soon.\r\n\r\nNote that in order to keep accurate ancestor state, `CTxMemPool::removeForBlock` has to walk the descendants of each in-block transaction (so that it's ancestor state can be reflected for the ancestor which was confirmed).  The performance hit appears to be relatively insignificant (at least on the mempools I was looking at from 10/1/15 - 10/10/15): it amounted to an average 0.3ms, from 10.9ms to 11.2ms, on my almost 2 year old hardware.  Moreover, I think if this performance was ever an issue we could do a bigger re-engineering of `ConnectBlock` so that block relay isn't held up by updating the mempool state.\r\n\r\nI would like to also expose this ancestor information via RPC, but will hold off until after #7292, so I might do that in a future PR rather than in this one.  Also, the unit tests in this PR will be improved somewhat after #7539.",
