But please let's not add any policy code until we have a complete Consensus::VerifyTx(). \r\nWait a minute, Consensus::VerifyTx() doesn't even exist on master yet, not in a complete form and neither in an incomplete form.\r\n\r\nNit: Let's please introduce Consensus::VerifyTx() before exposing anything else, otherwise you'll have to duplicate some code from AcceptToMemoryPool and/or ConnectBlock.

Looks like just what I need.\r\n<runeks> But, as others in the pull request have mentioned, we better be damn sure that its return result is *always* the same as that of sendrawtransaction.\r\n<runeks> Looking at the code, to me it doesn't seem trivial achieve this.\r\n<runeks> Implementation-wise, it would seem a lot more robust to use the same code path as sendrawtransaction, but abort before the transaction is committed, and just return \"valid\".\r\n<wumpus> that would be a non-trivial impact to the current transaction handling code\r\n<wumpus> not a good idea with all the softforks etc going on\r\n<wumpus> anyhow, closing it then, feel free to implement it in a way you think is better\r\n<wumpus> I thought this was a good way to get the API merged, it could always be improved later\r\n<wumpus> also the 'verify multiple transactions' part would be more difficult to implement if you want to bolt this onto main.cpp\r\n```\r\nI don't however want to just bolt this on to main.cpp in the current state. Without refactors that'd make the code even harder to understand, and makes it virtually impossible to handle multiple dependent transactions without actually writing to the mempool.\r\n(and the mempool logic in AcceptToMempool really gets in the way, e.g. the replacment logic)\r\n\r\nSo if this solution is not acceptable for the mean time, I suppose we should wait for those refactors to materialize first.",
