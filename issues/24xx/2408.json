   "body" : "On Windows, select() is limited to 64 sockets by default.  As a result, Bitcoin can communicate with no more than 63 peers.  (Not 64, because the listening socket is also passed to select().)  The default value of maxconnections=125 can never be reached.\r\n\r\nSince listening nodes are important to the network, this may be worth fixing.  All it takes is \"#define FD_SETSIZE 1024\" (or some other number greater than 64) before \"#include &lt;winsock2.h&gt;\" in compat.h.  I tried it locally and now have over 100 connections.",
