The latter seems to have been there for a long time, as a safety mechanism.\r\n\r\nHowever, this timer also keeps CNode objects alive for far longer than necessary after disconnects, potentially opening up a DoS window.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the timestamp-based mechanism, and replaces it with an assert(nRefCount >= 0), to verify that the refcounting is indeed correctly working.",
