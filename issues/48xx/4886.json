   "body" : "I recently installed Bitcoin Core v0.9.2.1 on Ubuntu. Started synchronizing with network and started up system monitor (not using internet with other applications). So it quickly starts going at max download speed, but after some time (maybe an hour or so) it slows down to like 10%. After restarting it does same thing.\r\nSo I have to restart Bitcoin Core every hour or so.\r\nDon't know what could be the problem, maybe connections start turning slower for some reason (other peers syncing maybe), but it doesn't look for better connections ( unless restarted when it looks for best connections).",
