For now, I've written up the description in a new comment on issue #156 (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/156#issuecomment-54737468), because it seems very likely that this is a regression of the older bug.  But if that's wrong, then I guess there's a shiny new seg fault instead.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, and please let me know if there's some better procedure I should have followed.",
