The final dump of the result to LevelDB takes 700MB extra.\r\n\r\nNote that this is just a memory usage improvement, and not a performance optimization as such: it doesn't attempt to keep modified non-dirty entries in memory, or do negative caching.\r\n\r\nThis builds upon #4822, which may be simpler to review.",
