That I could help with much more, as I'd like to see it happen. We already have a system for building dependencies on/for various platforms (it already builds for windows), it would need to be adapted for use on Windows. You could then use them to build bitcoin with mingw, or coerce it into building with msvc\r\n\r\n@theuni We could do that but to build all the dependencies and BitcoinD you don't need mingw. I do have a bitcoin-dev-msvc project which builds them all and runs on MS natively. \r\n\r\nQT was outside of my area of interest so far. It could be added, but I do not see it as a problem either, it was done once by Claire DuSoleil for version 0.8.6.\r\n",
