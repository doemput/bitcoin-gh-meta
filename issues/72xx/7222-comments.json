This would be useful IMO.\r\n\r\n> The answer can only be definitive for transactions that are in the mempool; transactions that are not in the mempool might have unknown parents which could signal RBF and we wouldn't know it. Is it worth trying to answer this question for transactions not in the mempool, and if so, what information should be returned?\r\n\r\nI don't see a use-case for getting the RBF signal for confirmed transactions (maybe for potential reorgs risk calculations?). But I agree, without `-txindex`, parents RBF signal is probably unknown.",

Not against this.\r\n\r\nAn indicator for BIP125 (in particular, in listtransactions) would be both labor saving for users, and also make it more likely that parties looking at it get it right (and, for example, don't consider confirmed transactions to be BIP125 mempool replaceable).\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was always my expectation that it would work this way-- and this small affordance is an aspect of how I explained BIP125 to others without getting any protest so I expect many also expected this. Importantly, while many people do objectively confused things with unconfirmed transactions, the elegance of BIP125 was that it avoided the difficult task of educating people which so far many have failed with; by providing something that allowed their activities to continue without conflict. But it doesn't do so if getting access to the information is too burdensome. Because of this I consider this a release blocker.\r\n\r\nI was concerned that the patch for this would be complex, but it turns out to be quite clean... which I think makes this a no-brainer. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
