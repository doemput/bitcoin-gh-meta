By returning early in `ProcessNewBlock`, we were not marking blocks that fail a check in `CheckBlock` as permanently failed, and thus would continue to re-request and reprocess them.\r\n\r\nThis should result in one fewer call to `CheckBlock` for valid blocks, at the expense of one extra call to `AcceptBlockHeader` for blocks that fail `CheckBlock`, and it avoids reprocessing those failed blocks over and over.\r\n\r\n",
