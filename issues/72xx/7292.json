   "body" : "This adds 3 new RPC calls (~~getancestors~~ getmempoolancestors, ~~getdescendants~~ getmempooldescendants, getmempoolentry) to expose more mempool information over RPC.\r\n\r\nNow that we have policy rules that are tied to transaction chains (including limits on the number of in-mempool ancestors and in-mempool descendants, and mempool eviction and RBF policies that depend on fees of descendants), it seems helpful to be able to expose more information about the chains a given tx is part of over RPC.\r\n\r\nThis is motivated by the discussion in #7222.  @petertodd You mentioned wanting to see specific use-cases for this information; I think there are clear improvements to the fee-bumping tools in your replace-by-fee repo that could be made if we had these functions (the first two tools I looked at just now don't seem to consider transaction chains at all in fee calculations?).  I'll try to post a link in this PR to specific proposed improvements when I have something to share that will demonstrate this more clearly.",
