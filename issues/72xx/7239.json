Does it check on startup if wallet.dat has all the correct private keys for every public key it contains? More importantly the private keys of those public keys listed in the UI on demand of \"Request payment\" button.\r\n(Does it also check when pressing that button?) \r\n\r\nI've been afraid of the hypothesis of sending coins to some address that i don't really have the private key due to some system failure. \r\n\r\n",
