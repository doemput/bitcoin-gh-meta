I don't think we should offer policies that don't make sense for a user to logically choose.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the motivation for someone turning off opt-in RBF in favor of a no-replacement policy?  If it's because they don't want to personally accept transactions that might be later replaced, then I think we should just make sure that bitcoind offers whatever tools a user would need to determine whether a transaction is opting-in, so the user can reject the payment if they choose.  Not accepting opt-in transactions at all seems much more useful to the user than locally choosing to not accept replacements of such transactions.  Breaking relay of opt-in RBF replacement transactions seems to offer no additional local benefits that I can see (at least, not any local benefits that can't be better achieved a different way), while it would provide some harm to part of the network (namely those users who might use it in the future).\r\n\r\nSo offering it as a policy might be confusing to people, since having the option implies there's a good reason some might want to turn it off, and I don't think there is such a reason.  (If there is currently a reason, say because bitcoind doesn't currently make it easy for users to know whether a transaction is opting-in, then I think we should make that easy instead, which is not difficult to implement.  If there are other reasons, I'd like to hear them.)\r\n\r\nI can understand the motivation for offering full-RBF, as it makes sense to me that some users might want that policy, but given the existence of opt-in RBF, is full-RBF likely to offer meaningfully different outcomes for what gets into your mempool?  I expect not, and I don't see the need for Bitcoin Core to support what has been a controversial policy that we expect would provide minimal actual benefit to users choosing to run it.",

      "body" : "> and is clearly much-desired by users.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr that would certainly influence my opinion.  Can you elaborate?  To @sdaftuar's point, they may want to be able to make txs non-replaceable, but that doesn't occur just by them changing their local policy.  I can't believe I'm suggesting this, but perhaps a more useful feature would be the ability to flag a single tx as non-replaceable, which might be something miners wanted to do if they want to mine a particular version of a spend.  Would require some changes to the RBF logic though..\r\n",

There is a separate debate as to whether people should be relying on zero-conf (they shouldn't), but if we are going to allow/encourage even a small percentage of miners to enable full-RBF then there is really no point adding the opt-in semantics to transactions, because zero-conf will be broken anyway for a significant % of blocks. Obviously miners today could still compile and run your full-RBF patch themselves, but that is significantly more work than simply enabling a flag in core.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am totally fine with the feature \"Make RBF policies optional\", but I think it would be dangerous to add a feature \"Allow nodes to opt in to full-RBF\" today. If the `nRbfPolicy = 1` option is removed (allowing only no-RBF or opt-in-RBF) then I have no issue with this PR.",

My understanding is that full-RBF is a controversial change and that many developers have argued against it, hence the compromise to support opt-in RBF transactions.\r\n\r\nCurrently no pools are running full-RBF that I am aware of, despite @petertodd's lobbying for this. Most miners have no interest in breaking existing use-cases for bitcoin or supporting merchant fraud. It is true that a single large mining pool could probably break zero-conf for everyone, but currently none have, and many bitcoin users/merchants would like to maintain the status quo (at least until more secure zero-conf alternatives have matured). What I am afraid of is that making this a built-in flag in bitcoin would make it easier to lobby unsuspecting miners into running full-RBF (\"hey, just enable this flag to earn more money\"), which is significantly more difficult than \"hey, just recompile bitcoin with my custom patch\".\r\n\r\nIs there any reason not to simply remove the full-RBF option from this PR, and stick to the stated intent (making opt-in RBF optional)?",

How many times does it have to be repeated that it is not necessary for 0-conf to be perfectly secure to still have value? It is all a matter of the cost/benefit trade-off for small payments.\r\n\r\n> IMO there is a delusion out there that 0-conf can be made safe when in really can't be.\r\n\r\nI don't think anybody is saying 0-conf can be made safe.

For example, if pulling off a double spend attack is fairly difficult and expensive to do with FSS-behavior across the network, then that means it is very unlikely that attack actually happens a lot (for small payments). So the issue is not a lack of attackers, but rather your failure of identifying the lacking incentives that causes the attackers to not actually attack.\r\n\r\nBtw.: This is a little off-topic but the exact same applies to block size limits. If there would be no limit, an attacker would be very unlikely to make a really big, over sized block because the orphan risk for himself would be too great. Additionally, the reputation loss would be critical and could lead to an exclusion of the miner from the rest of the network. In reality this attack will probably never happen. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it does not make sense to design the system in favor of complete adversarial conditions. In both the case of full-RBF and also block size limits, Bitcoin Core is actually threatened to become a dangerous client to run considering the overall health of the Bitcoin network (0-conf reliability and congestion effects). And this is all due to the fact that there is too much fear of adversarial conditions and not enough trust in game theory.",

And what about windows/mac users who are happy to change a shortcut or conf file, but aren't going to download an untrusted binary?  The upstream project, us, has some trust.\r\n\r\nSince you also proposed a [straight change to the default](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7119/files#diff-12635a58447c65585f51d32b7e04075bR54) earlier that @btcdrak questioned and @gmaxwell closed, your position is clearly pro-RBF, and not pro-opt-in-RBF.  \r\n",

      "body" : "@petertodd note for the record I am no longer affiliated with Coinbase, so information may be a little out of date and opinions here are my own.\r\n\r\nThe biggest target for 0-conf scammers are gift cards (both dedicated gift retailers, and regular merchants who sell gift cards). These are usually delivered electronically and easily be cashed out via purse.io or similar with little to no verified KYC. Generally the bitcoin payment processor eats the fraud cost once a transaction is marked as accepted via their API, so even though the retailer could simply cancel the gift card (if they were fast enough), they have no incentive to, and these systems are usually not automated anyway.\r\n\r\nRequiring confirmations is also not even possible for some merchants (for example: legacy e-commerce systems which cannot place a hold on inventory longer than 15 or 30 minutes, when a single bitcoin confirmation can sometimes take upwards of 1 hour). So these merchants would probably opt to stop receiving bitcoin payments altogether rather than wait for confirmations. Arguably this is not a huge loss for the bitcoin ecosystem, since very few people are using bitcoin to make online purchases where credit cards are already accepted, but it would be disappointing to see nonetheless.\r\n\r\nGenerally I believe fraud costs are currently at an acceptable level (because merchants are still accepting 0-conf). However, if the _% of mining power running full-RBF_ ever increases above _% discount which gift cards can be flipped online_, it would significantly alter the economics here.",
