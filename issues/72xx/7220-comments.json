The current logic prevents free relay attacks by requiring that the new transaction still have enough to pay for its own relay, even after paying for all the fees being evicted -- so the total fee in the mempool is now at least minRelayFee higher after the replacement.\r\n\r\nAs @morcos pointed out, this pull would allow the total fee in the mempool to increase by as little as 1 satoshi as the result of a replacement.  This allows someone to relay transactions for less than the minRelayFee as long as they're evicting something else.  NACK.",

I already said this doesn't work in It's current state and it could only work if it can/will factor in the minimum fees for all transactions replaced in the chain (making it literally impossible to pay any less than the sum of all minimum fees) I guess that's impossible if they're completely dropped from mempool.\r\n\r\nI still agree with the concept so I'm hesitant to NACK this. If considering all minfees for all previously replaced TXs is impossible then NACK but I don't think it is. The node could even keep some information about the dropped TXs (size, and anything relevant for future fee calcs maybe) lingering for such calculations until the final TX is mined, it'd be fast, and wouldn't allow anyone to pay under the minimum fee. Is that outside of the scope of this PR though? ",

That is actually what this PR does.   But the free relay attack @morcos described is still correct; note that his example didn't have anything to do with chains.  Say you have a transaction in the mempool with no descendants that pays 2 times the minRelayFee.  Then this PR would allow you to evict it by sending a new transaction that pays 1 satoshi more, which you could then repeat over and over again...\r\n",
