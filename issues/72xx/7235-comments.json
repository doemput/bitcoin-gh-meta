      "body" : "> Please explain how someone can lose bitcoins this way.\r\n\r\nSimple: Sell them bitcoin, tell them to download Core to receive. Make it look like you sent them coins, show them fake block explorer etc. and convince them \"don't worry, they'll show up in your wallet once you sync, go home and sync, buddy.\"\r\n\r\nLess Simple: Core not syncing. Bitcoins not arriving. Panic, ask online somewhere. Not understanding jargon. White Knight shows up with solution. Turns out it was scammer that just asked to send private keys, and did.\r\n\r\nEven Less Simple: dump private keys. import to Electrum or something. Continue using the same keys and forget that the private keys were copied to their memo app in the interim (or evernote or whatever) then someday coins get stolen.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nBasically, it seems like Core is saying \"hmm, users understand all this stuff and we have no obligation to educate them... if they lose bitcoins it wasn't because of us, but rather them. They should have known not to trust coins without fully syncing, or to give someone private keys, or to copy paste dumped private keys to some cloud service with \"password1234\" as their password. Not our fault, their fault.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that Core should rather say \"Hey, you're the new guy around here. Here's a nice little tour of the place. We've got your addresses right here, but you don't need those yet, as we can't verify anything you did with them even if you tried. In order to do that, you need to wait x hours and download approx. y GB. If that doesn't sound cool, we could turn on SPV mode if you want. How about that?\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that kind of tutorial does not exist in the app itself, and the SPV mode is not there. So the very least that could be done rather quickly, is hide addresses from the UI.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why hiding addresses that have 0 use to a newbie (until he can see the transactions) is such a big deal?\r\n\r\nAnyone who's not a new person can just getaddress to their hearts content in the console.while syncing.\r\n\r\nBeing aware of the problem at hand, and refusing to do anything about it is the same as implicitly stating \"we want users to send large quantities of bitcoin into a Core address on their wallet so they are forced to either sync fully, or do unsafe things at the advice of internet forums.\"",

You should be able to give out an address to pay while not synced. Users that do understand how things work would be inconvenienced by this proposal (one practical example: I have a node that I run only intermittently; every time I start it it has to catch up. Having to wait for it to catch up before being able to give out an address every time would be extremely frustrating).\r\n\r\nMaking the \"Not synced\" warning more apparent makes sense, though. Agree with adding some text with what the implications of not being synced are \"you will only see up-to-date transactions/balance when catched up with the chain\".",

Also tell them not to send any goods to anyone until they're done syncing.

When you've left the wallet closed for a year, the same problem happens.\r\nNot so sure about a popup, you could just put a warning at the top with big red letters.\r\n\r\n> Is it hard to add such a warning? I'd be willing to invest a few hours.\r\n\r\nNo, should be easy to do, as GUI changes go.\r\n\r\n(writing this after receiving a panicked Ukrainian mail about the same thing)",
