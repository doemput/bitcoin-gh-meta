When the process had naturally exited, the chainstate folder was just a few KB in size and indeed after starting the software it is now re-syncing from disk. This is new.\r\n\r\nTrying it now on a completely fresh Win7 SP1 x64 VM with just Bitcoin Core installed: Killing the process 6 times never caused corruption. Powering off the VM frequently causes corruption. This is on a magnetic disk now and the corruption comes about 1 in 3 times. So this test shows that the Windows instance is not somehow messed up.\r\n\r\nI unplugged my SSD once. Also caused corruption.\r\n\r\nJust checked the NTFS file systems in all test VMs: No corruption. This is evidence against the disks violating their durability guarantees.\r\n\r\nTonight I experienced a blue screen. The old VM became corrupt. The new VM did not report corruption but reindexing started at block zero.\r\n\r\nI can only encourage you to experiment with different ways of interrupting Bitcoin Core. You will find \"unexplained phenomena\".\r\n\r\nI'll let this rest now and will stop testing. I recommend to regularly backup the chainstate folder. It's not too big and it can save a tremendous amount of time in case something happens.",
