This makes it slightly more bothersome to change the name of the project, because changing the AC_INIT line in configure.ac isn't sufficient.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is something you want to fix in your repo, since it mostly only affects downstream projects like Namecoin.  If you are interested in fixing this, I'd be happy to submit a PR.",
