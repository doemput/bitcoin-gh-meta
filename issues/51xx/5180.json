   "body" : "EDIT:\r\n\r\nThis prepares AcceptToMemoryPool to be decoupled from Params() and creates a -policy command-line option to select the standard or test policy independently of the chain mode (ie main, testnet3, regtest).\r\n \r\nIt's based on #6068.\r\n@petertodd already acked the concept here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5521#issuecomment-67774957\r\n\r\nOLD:\r\nInstead of being based on #5071 as initially, it doesn't go as far as that PR. \r\nA rebased version of #5071 on top of this PR can be found here: https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/tree/nodepolicy_5180\r\nInstead of being based on #5071 it is based on #5521 (plus one doubt-commit).\r\n\r\nPlease let's not delay policy.o even if it's only with ```minRelayTxFee```.\r\nLater proposals to expand policy.o become more readable once the first step has been walked.\r\nEven better, later proposed changes to main.o may become proposed changes to policy.o!!\r\nIn my opinion the biggest development bottleneck is reviewing changes to main.o.\r\n\r\n/EDIT\r\nIt's based on #5071 and eliminates Params().RequireStandard() by separating two policies for the 4 networks accessible with Params() as discussed in that PR.\r\nIt also includes a couple of \"squashme\" commits that solve my complains on #5071 in case you @luke-jr want to take them.",
