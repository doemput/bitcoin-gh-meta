P2Pool users must run a full Bitcoin node which serves the purpose of independently validating transactions and the Bitcoin blockchain. P2Pool also supports merged mining and several alternative blockchains.\r\nP2Pool nodes work on a chain of shares similar to Bitcoin's blockchain. Each node works on a block that includes payouts to the previous shares' owners and the node itself, which can also result in a share if it meets P2Pool's difficulty.\r\nBecause of the importance of strengthening Bitcoin's decentralization, some Bitcoin supporters donate to P2Pool miners, resulting in average returns above 100% of the expected reward.
