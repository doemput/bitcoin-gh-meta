If you just created\nthe transaction yourself or mined the block yourself, this is an obvious\ntruth.\n\nSo, alternative proposal: trigger DoS scoring when receiving an\nunadvertized tx/block that you do already have.\n\nPros:\n* Optimizes propagation latency slightly.\n* Is conpatible with all existing behavior in clients afaik.\n\nCons:\n* More complex network rule.\n* Assumes that every peer (or at least every NODE_NETWORK peer) will be\ninterested in the actual tx/block (which is currently likely the case, but\nwe don't know the future variety of network nodes).",
