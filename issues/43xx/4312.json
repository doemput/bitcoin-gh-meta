It's his work, I've just integrated it into our build-system.\r\nThis was done in a few stages:\r\n- Add libtool dependency. I've tried to update all relevant docs, but very possible I missed some. Note that we don't actually make real use of libtool yet, it's only used when linking the subproject.\r\n- Pull in libsecp256k1 subtree\r\n- Add configure option \"--enable-libsecp256k1\". This is disabled by default.\r\n- Update the makefiles to link against the lib where necessary\r\n- Finally, add in the actual implementation.",
