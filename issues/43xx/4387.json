In this case, the modified node will not send the inv of the next block to prompt the requesting node to send a further getblocks.\r\n\r\nA solution to this is to make nodes able to detect when the sending node has stopped sending blocks (e.g. a block isn't being sent immediately after the last block was received). In this case, it can determine that the SyncNode is no longer a SyncNode and re-select a SyncNode to which to send the next getblocks.",
