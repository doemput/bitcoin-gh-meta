   "body" : "I just checked out the new 0.9 release and started it and i was really wondering why i see the most strangest dialect/slang in my bitcoin client. \r\nAt first I thought i downloaded a fake version of bitcoin or a compromised one, until I found out that the default language was switched to DE_AT - which was obviously build only as slang/dialect language.\r\n\r\nAfter switching to DE it looks ok, but i was really shocked that I see such a nonsense-language (completely only slang) in my bitcoin wallet - AS DEFAULT. A place where i don't want to see any funny things!!!! There are much better places to see funny things than in the bitcoin wallet. This is absolutely not acceptable from my point of view.\r\n\r\nImagine that I want to show this to some other people, which dont know bitcoin - they will for sure think i want to make a joke about them. I can understand that it is maybe funny - for some 15 year old teenagers. But for introducing bitcoin as a mature payment service - this is a absolutely no go - specially when the DEFAULT language is adjusted to this dialect speech.\r\n\r\nAnyone agrees with me?\r\n![bildschirmfoto 2014-03-20 um 22 06 16](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/10075/2477663/8f0cc3b0-b073-11e3-92dd-ef223bfb16fe.png)\r\n",
