Just look at how we initialize here a TableViewLastColumnResizingFixer object when setting up the table header's behavior, and then how we override the resize event of the component (can be the table, or the dialog) and we invoke columnResizingFixer->stretchColumnWidth(columnIndex);\r\n\r\nWhen the window is resized, the second to last column is stretched like before, this was the last fix done.\r\n\r\nVideo demoing fix here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkcPO1sLGX8&feature=youtu.be",
