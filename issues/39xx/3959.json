For example, imagine\r\n25 buckets each containing the full 100 entries. Those 2,500 samples are sorted, and the estimate of the fee needed to confirm in the very next block is the 50'th-highest-fee-entry in that sorted list; the estimate of the fee needed to confirm in the next two blocks is the 150'th-highest-fee-entry, etc.\r\n\r\nThat algorithm has the nice property that estimates of how much fee you need to pay to get confirmed in block N will always be greater than or equal to the estimate for block N+1. It would clearly be wrong\r\nto say \"pay 11 uBTC and you'll get confirmed in 3 blocks, but pay 12 uBTC and it will take LONGER\".\r\n\r\nA single block will not contribute more than 10 entries to any one bucket, so a single miner and a large block cannot overwhelm the estimates.",
