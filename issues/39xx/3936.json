This commit resolves these errors by building Boost from source.\r\nBuilding from HEAD removes the guarantee of a repeatable build, but this\r\nappears to be a necessity until the next version of Boost is released.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this writing, the [current version of Boost is 1.55.0][2]. \r\nPresumably, the next release will include the changes now on HEAD, and once\r\nthat new version has been [made available in Homebrew][3], this commit should\r\nbe reverted.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/9704573\r\n[2]: http://www.boost.org/users/history\r\n[3]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/boost.rb",
