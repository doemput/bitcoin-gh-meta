Instead of it, I think, It will be nice to add a way to set address (with IPv6 support, btw) and port where user wants to connect. And set default address value to \"localhost\" (assumed user installed bitcoind and gui on the same machine by default).\nBut this way will add possibility (for advanced users) to set up bitcoind somewhere far far away and use only GUI part on localhost ;)",
