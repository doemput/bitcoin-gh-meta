   "body" : "blkindex.dat stores all kinds of data, and as such, each key is overloaded to\nform a namespace.  All keys beginning with \"blockindex\" form the\nhash->CBlockIndex data that is loaded into mapBlockIndex.\n\nThis change moves mapBlockIndex data to its own database, custom tailored for\nthe sort of data we wish to store:\n\n- BDB type changed from btree to hash\n- key is uint256 hash, with no prefixes\n\nUsage is cleaner, and uses slightly less CPU and disk space than the previous\nsolution.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY STATUS: A new block chain must be downloaded, or at least reindexed.  As such, may want to delay this change, if other major database changes are planned.\n\nMERGE STATUS: Ready for review and comment, but not ready for immediate upstreaming.\n",
