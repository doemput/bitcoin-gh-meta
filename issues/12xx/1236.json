I wonder how many have just silently just abandoned bitcoin after trying and not seeing the transaction in their client. \r\n  http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/tcy73/help_i_withdrew_funds_from_mtgox_gave_them_my/\r\n< Eliel> it's not clearly visible from the UI that you can't expect transactions to show up before the blockchain download is complete. There's also plenty of people who don't read instructions.\r\n< Eliel> I think a good way to fix this would be to show a note on the top of the transaction list that says \"blockchain still downloading, some transactions may not show up\"\r\n",
