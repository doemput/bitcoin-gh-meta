   "body" : "Gets rid of `MainFrameRepaint` in favor of specific update functions that tell the UI exactly what changed.\r\n\r\n- This improves the efficiency of various handlers (no unnecessary balance recalculations). \r\n- Also fixes the problem with mined transactions not showing up until restart.\r\n- As this finally makes it possible for the UI to know when a new alert arrived, it can be shown as OS notification.\r\n- New addresses are selected again in address book (was a regression in 0.6.1)\r\n\r\nThe following notifications were added:\r\n\r\n- `NotifyBlocksChanged`: Block chain changed\r\n- `NotifyKeyStoreStatusChanged`: Wallet status (encrypted, locked) changed.\r\n- `NotifyAddressBookChanged`: Address book entry changed.\r\n- `NotifyTransactionChanged`: Wallet transaction added, removed or updated.\r\n- `NotifyNumConnectionsChanged`: Number of connections changed.\r\n- `NotifyAlertChanged`: New, updated or cancelled alert.\r\n\r\nThese notifications could also be useful for RPC clients. However, currently, they are ignored in bitcoind.\r\n\r\nAlso brings back polling with timer for numBlocks in ClientModel. This value updates so frequently during initial download that the number of signals clogs the UI thread and causes heavy CPU usage. And after initial block download, the value changes so rarely that a delay of half a second until the UI updates is unnoticable.\r\n\r\n**Second commit converts UI interface to boost::signals**:\r\n\r\n- Core no longer links to any UI functions directly, but the UI subscribes to notifications through boost::signals.\r\n- Signals now go directly from the core to WalletModel/ClientModel.\r\n  - WalletModel subscribes to signals on CWallet: Prepares for multi-wallet support, by no longer assuming an implicit global wallet.\r\n- Gets rid of noui.cpp, the few lines that were left are merged into init.cpp\r\n- Rename wxXXX message flags to MF_XXX, to make them UI indifferent.\r\n- ThreadSafeMessageBox converted to void, no longer returns the value `4` which was never used",
