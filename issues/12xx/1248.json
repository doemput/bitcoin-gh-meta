I was thinking if it could fit in \"Main\", which it does, but I think the best thing would be to rename \"Window\" into \"Client\".\r\n\r\nThis is self-explaining, all options that are in there are Client-Options and not only options for the Client-Window (and that's how I understand the current wording). I propose to rename the whole WindowOptionsPage stuff into ClientOptionsPage, to make this a whole. I have no problem with creating a pull for this, but at first what do you think?",
