Given that they do not need to cope with locks being in shared memory, they are different and simpler on some systems.\n\nThis commit replaces all sync.{h,cpp} infrastructure by systems provided by boost/thread/*.\n\nSo far, it seems to work well on Linux, OSX and BSD (the latter two required a workaround before, as the interprocess semaphores and condition variables used spinlocks - it seems the thread ones don't).",
