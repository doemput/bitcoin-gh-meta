The values are static once the program is initialized, so initialize pathDataDir once.\n\nGetDataDir() is renamed to GetPrepDataDir() to better indicate that it has side effects.\n\nCurious to see whether people think this is worth merging or not.  I think it cleans up the code, and is ever so slightly more CPU efficient for most use cases.\n",
