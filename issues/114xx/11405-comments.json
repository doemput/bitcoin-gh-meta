      "body" : "What you're asking for is possible but would result in extra resource usage for full nodes. Such a new rule would be implemented like this:  \r\n\r\n1. When address Y is created with this special rule, the owner broadcasts transaction X specifying that address Y can only accept amount Z, no more or less, and no further transactions after balance Z is reached.  \r\n2. After transaction X is confirmed, all nodes would then have to check each new transaction that is relayed to make sure it conforms with the rule set by transaction X. It's basically adding a new protocol rule for each address that has this special rule.  \r\n3. Any transactions (or blocks that include such transactions) that violate this rule for address Y will be rejected as invalid.  \r\n\r\nSo this special rule will result in at least 2x blockchain load for each special address that is used (one tx to create the rule, one tx to receive the payment) and will also result in an additional resource load on all nodes (akin to permanently increasing the UTXO set by the number of special addresses that are created, since the rule must be enforced forever).  \r\n\r\nTo sum up, you have two concerns:  \r\n\r\n1. You don't want people to reuse an address, and  \r\n2. You only want the address to accept a specified amount.  \r\n\r\n(1) can be addressed using [BIP-0047](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) bitcoin payment codes. (2) can be addressed off-chain using e.g. [BIP-0070](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki) payment requests; if the payer overpays, you can refund them the difference, and if the payer underpays, you (or the UI) can tell them as much and request they send more, else refund the balance (minus tx fees, perhaps).
