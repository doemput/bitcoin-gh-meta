   "body" : "This is a small step towards better multi wallet management. Starts by removing the global `vpwallets` and adding an interface to add/remove/retrieve wallets.\r\n\r\nThe way it is now it is possible to have, for instance, `listunspent` RPC and in parallel unload the wallet (once #10740 is merged) without blocking. Once the RPC finishes, the shared pointer will release the wallet.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to get all existing wallets without blocking because the caller keeps a local list of shared pointers.\r\n\r\nI would like to include either here or in follow ups:\r\n- kind of `WalletManager` class;\r\n- keep a weak pointer so when the app terminates it is possible to gracefully unload the wallet;\r\n- make the new interface thread safe.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this RFC.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #10615, #11383 and #10740.",
