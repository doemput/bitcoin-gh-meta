      "body" : "Thanks for tackling this @achow101 . I'd echo @TheBlueMatt's feedback that labels needs to be in place before we remove the accounts system. The `-deprecatedrpc` framework was put in place with a specific purpose: to make sure that RPCs can be removed or changed in a release without suddenly breaking clients. The idea is that the `-deprecatedrpc` option is only in place for a single release before the RPC is removed entirely. Without a plan already in place to migrate wallets to the label system and fully remove the accounts system, this feels like an abuse of the `-deprecatedrpc` mechanism.\r\n\r\nAt a conceptual level, I'm not convinced that accounts system removal should depend on node version. It feels far more appropriate for it to be dependant on the wallet version than the node version.",
