   "body" : "Closes #11348 \r\n\r\nAdds a `-walletdir` parameter which specifies a directory to use for wallets, allowing them to be stored separately from the 'main' data directory.\r\n\r\nAlso modifies `listwallets` to return a list of 'available' wallets in the wallet directory. Currently if the default data directory is in use, it returns all .dat files there including peers, banlist, etc. which might need to be changed, feedback would be good. Is there a better way to know if something is a wallet rather than just checking for `*.dat`? Because I think it would be worse to perform some weird check to only list available files if the directory isnt the default\r\n\r\nTo-do:\r\n- [ ] Cleanup by removing caching of data directory paths and instead just initialise them once on startup? (c.f. #3073)\r\n- [ ] Create a new `wallets/` directory in datadir if this is the first time running\r\n- [x] Add release notes\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n\r\nI think the two things left go hand in hand, somewhere in the program initialisation the checks for existing directories would be made, and if the data directory doesn't exist and no `-walletdir` is specified it would create both at once (this way it knows it's a fresh install).",
