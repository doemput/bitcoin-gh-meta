The problem this is solving is not having a way to tell where in the test script execution has reached when there's a failure. I've done that with the smallest change I could.\r\n\r\nWe should stop using the comparison test framework entirely for these static tests (see https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/2017-06-15/?msg=87309124&page=3) so I don't intend to make bigger changes than is necessary.",
