If they found it valid, the header will be relayed and we will then ban them. Otherwise we keep the connection.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that our newly connected nodes are also following the same consensus rules, we ask them for the headers of blocks that we know are invalid when they connect after the version handshake. If they respond with a header, then we will ban them.\r\n\r\nThis still needs tests, but I'm not sure how we should do that. If you have any suggestions, I'm all ears.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNote, I know the implementation is slightly wrong, still working on it.",
