It probably is worth discussing more, but I guess not here (I didn't realize this PR was only intended be a standalone cleanup).\r\n\r\nI think we need to a better job reviewing cleanup PR's like this. It seems like when a PR making a stylistic change gets posted, there's either a contentious debate with ACKs and NACKs and exaggerated comments about why the change is wonderful or terrible, or people withhold opinions and ignore the PR because they don't want to risk starting an unproductive debate.\r\n\r\nMaybe a better way to handle cleanup changes would be to do a noncommital round of polling before asking for hard ACKs and NACKs, asking maybe 4 or 5 developers to take an initial look at the change and write a sentence saying whether they like, dislike, or are indifferent to it. [Apache's voting system](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#expressing-votes-1-0-1-and-fractions) could be useful for this:\r\n\r\n> +0: 'I don't feel strongly about it, but I'm okay with this.'\r\n> -0: 'I won't get in the way, but I'd rather we didn't do this.'\r\n> -0.5: 'I don't like this idea, but I can't find any rational justification for my feelings.'\r\n> ++1: 'Wow! I like this! Let's do it!'\r\n> -0.9: 'I really don't like this, but I'm not going to stand in the way if everyone else wants to go ahead with it.'\r\n\r\nThis way people would feel more free to comment on cleanup PRs without forming hard opinions or getting sucked into debate, so cleanup authors could get quicker feedback on their PRs, and make faster decisions on whether to close, improve, or move forward with their changes, and there could be less of a cleanup PR backlog.",

I like that the change groups deployments and would merge it even though I think grouping them under a struct would be a better than grouping them in an array. Arrays with constant offsets are more verbose than structs, less flexible, and also brittle like matt pointed out. I'd probably use a struct for vb deployments as well, or anything else I didn't think code would frequently be iterating over.",
