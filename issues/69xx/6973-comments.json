Currenlty my only benchmark is with a 600MB\nblockchain.  Takes 3:47 to sync without compression and 1:25 with\ncompression.

      "body" : "Interesting to see someone trying this.\r\n\r\nMatt's relay network protocol can achieve _much_ better compaction (e.g. sending a 1MB block in a couple kilobytes); and considering zlib's security non-track record... this doesn't excite me greatly. Then one must consider the potential adverse effect on the system from punishing people for failing to reuse addresses, which is another impact matt's protocol does not have.\r\n\r\nGiven the approach these numbers seemed suspect to me-- but I can verify them*. When we tested gzipping single block yeas ago we got _much_ worse results... I wonder how much this is due to spam attack transactions (where pubkeys/txouts are repeated unusually often)?\r\n\r\nI'd like to better understand where the compression is coming from, and I think it's critical that we do so: The only significant gains this should really be getting is from reused pubkeys, which is quite concerning.  Protocol aware compression could likely do better (e.g. blocks can't spend outputs that don't exist.) without that problem.\r\n\r\nBetter than compressing blocks may be be compressing the stream of transactions, as doing that is not exclusive with the relay network protocol style compression; though it would continue the problem of punishing people who do not behave in a fungiblity destroying manner.\r\n\r\nFor mining block relay performance is a consideration; adding 90ms is an considerable fraction of the total processing time.  For non-latency critical relay (e.g. nodes not involved anywhere near mining) a process that used mempool set reconciliation on just the txids, then more round trips to send the unknowns would be the bandwidth minimizing but (again) it wouldn't be exclusive with compressing the transactions which are sent further.\r\n\r\nThis would perhaps be more interesting if we also considered a flag to ask peers to never  inv/send loose transactions... a blocks only node would not gain from set reconciliation.\r\n\r\n*Here are some recent results:\r\n```\r\n$ for i in {382658..382558} ; do

      "body" : "@gmaxwell After running several tests the data is showing there is about a 20% compression benefit and surprisingly a slight improvement in performance particularly when latency is present.  It seems that in the past this was looked into but dropped but I'm wondering if in the past gzip was used as a comparison rather than the zlib library directly.  Gzip while based on zlib, can add additional metadata to a file and I don't think you have the option of selecting compression levels with gzip and maybe that's where the difference lies.\r\n\r\nAs far as moving forward, I'd like to keep working on this and see that there is some benefit to perhaps enhancing the code further, trying out different compression libraries...  But I'm a little unclear on where this should go from here.  I'm wondering if this really does need a BIP given the compression feature can be turned fully on/off  through config settings and it's backward compatible with previous versions (advertising as a service).  It doesn't seem that this is a major change to bitcoin but rather just another feature that is configurable? I'd like to get your guidance on this.",

For example, that keeps a little 256 entry LFU cache for txouts scriptpubkey and a 256 entry cache for 'script sigs' the first push if there are two and first two if there are more than two.  I think such a construction could get equal (or perhaps better) compression than zlib and be much faster.
