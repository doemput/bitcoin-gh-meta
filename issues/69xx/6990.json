What I expected was that it sets a timeout, given that no other pending events it would exit in N seconds. However, what it does was delay the event loop exit with N seconds, even if nothing is pending.\r\n\r\nSolve it in a different way: give the event loop thread time to exit out of itself, and if it doesn't, send loopbreak (and then join it).\r\n\r\nThis speeds up the RPC tests a lot, each exit incurred a 10 second overhead, with this change there should be no shutdown overhead in the common case and up to two seconds if the event loop is blocking.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus this breaks dependency on the global boost::thread_group, as the HTTP server minds its own offspring.\r\n\r\nTime for rpctests with this patch:\r\n```\r\nreal    7m50.215s\r\nuser    0m30.152s\r\nsys     0m11.752s\r\n```\r\nWithout:\r\n```\r\nreal    13m12.069s\r\nuser    0m30.412s\r\nsys     0m11.168s\r\n```",
