If you miss the original message and you don't tend to scan backwards past the most recent startup, you'll see a comforting `LoadBlockIndexDB: hashBestChain=...` and `No coin database inconsistencies in last N blocks` at startup, and you'll see the node acquiring peers; you might see more `ConnectInputs failed` and `AcceptToMemoryPool: non-final` than usual, but nothing explicit to alert you to the fact that the longest chain is considered invalid, nor why.\r\n\r\n@laanwj suggests \"'timestamp too far in the future' is a temporary condition, it probably shouldn't cache it indefinitely\"; failing that, maybe it's easy enough to get caught in this trap that it merits an extra startup-time breadcrumb in the logs.",
