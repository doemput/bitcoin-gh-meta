On the other hand estimatefee usually recommends a much higher fee than actually required for the confirmation target, and this may lead to artificial fee inflation.  When a transaction using the recommended fee/priority doesn't go through in the first block, there is usually something else, e.g. individual miner policy, preventing it.",
