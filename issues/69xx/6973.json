   "body" : "Compress Blocks before sending achieves an average of 21% block compression.\r\n\r\nWhen blocks are almost full and at the highest Zlib setting,level 9, there is an average 22% block compression and takes 0.19 seconds to compress.  At level 6 (which has been set as the default) there is 21% block compression but only takes 0.09 seconds.  Decompression is very fast in all cases averaging only 0.008 seconds. \r\n\r\nNOTE: all block data used to gather these numbers was from mainnet and compression was done  using a 4 year old laptop with a Celeron processor.  (Current i7 processors are  8 times more powerful)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
