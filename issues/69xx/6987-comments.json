      "diff_hunk" : "@@ -0,0 +1,35 @@\n+Reduce Traffic\n+==============\n+\n+Some node operators need to deal with bandwith caps imposed by their ISPs.\n+\n+By default, bitcoin-core allows up to 125 connections to different peers, 8 of\n+which are outbound. You can therefore, have at most 117 inbound connections.\n+\n+The default settings can result in relatively significant traffic consumption.\n+\n+Ways to reduce traffic:\n+\n+## 1. Use `-maxuploadtarget=<MiB per day>`\n+\n+A major component of the traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to other nodes\n+during the initial blocks download phase (syncing up a new node).\n+This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default.\n+This is *not* a hard limit; only a threshold to minimize the outbound\n+traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by no\n+longer serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).\n+Keep in mind that new nodes require other nodes that are willing to serve\n+historic blocks. **The recommended minimum is 144 blocks per day (max. 144MB\n+per day)**\n+\n+## 2. Disable \"listening\" (`-listen=0`)\n+\n+Disabling listening will result in fewer nodes connected (remember the maximum of 8\n+outbound peers). Fewer nodes will result in less traffic usage as you are relaying\n+blocks and transactions to fewer nodes.\n+\n+## 3. Reduce maximum connections (`-maxconnections=<num>`)\n+\n+Reducing the maximum connected nodes to a miniumum could be desirable if traffic\n+limits are tiny. Keep in mind that bitcoins trustless model works best if you are\n+connected to a handfull of nodes.",
