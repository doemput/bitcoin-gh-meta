IMO the wallet should keep it's own height cache or even it's own headers-only-chain (anyways required in case of process separation).\r\n\r\nBut anyways; the bitcoin-core local wallet (and other wallets) need to find a way to handle removed transactions from the mempool without marking them as conflicted.\r\n\r\nBut you are saying using inputs from a conflicted transaction results in a double-spend? The transaction was removed from the mempool and is not in the chain,... that means it's available again for coin selection, isn't it?",
