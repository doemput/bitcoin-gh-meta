   "body" : "Motivation: Create keys on a secure system using only OpenSSL or similar software.  Receive BTC, then when ready to spend them, use importkey in a running client.\n\nimportkey &lt;file&gt; &lt;account&gt;\nReads a PEM-encoded keypair from file and adds it to the wallet.\nTo create a keypair with OpenSSL, use:\n    openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -out NEW_KEY.pem -genkey\nReturns the key's bitcoin address.\n\n$ bitcoind importkey ~/NEW_KEY.pem TestAcct\nmt5M3Qa7fXsUV3bK6WtWTZEvXY2M1UPEgv\n\nBug: I'd like to safeguard against overwriting a key in the wallet with bogus data.\nBug: I don't understand what has to be mutexed.\nBug: Should do anything possible to make sure the imported key is valid.\n\nNote: I did not implement the corresponding export function, because my use case does not require it.  I will be happy to implement it if this will improve the patch's chance of acceptance.\n\nNote: To make this convenient, one (I) would write a little script to read one of these PEM files and print a Bitcoin address.  All key handling would be possible offline, and certainly in the absence of a block chain, until spend time.  For my next trick, expect offline transaction signing and an importtx function.\n\nForum topic: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9046.0\n",
