   "body" : "Introduces four new RPC calls:\r\n* dumpprivkey:    retrieve the private key corresponding to an address\r\n* importprivkey:   add a private key to your wallet\r\n* removeprivkey: remove a private key from your wallet \r\n* dumpwallet:      export the contents of your wallet in various ways\r\n* importwallet:     import/merge a dumped wallet into your own.\r\n\r\nThe private key format is analoguous to the address format. It is\r\na 51-character base58-encoded string, that includes a version number\r\nand a checksum.\r\n\r\nThe wallet format is JSON-based, and includes:\r\n* addresses (informational, optional)\r\n* private keys\r\n* amounts per balance (informational, optional)\r\n* blocks where addresses were first used (optional)\r\n* ids of transactions in which addresses were credited (optional)\r\n* labels (optional)\r\n\r\nIt specifically does not contain:\r\n* sender address book\r\n* settings\r\n* account information\r\n* unconfirmed wallet transactions\r\n\r\nNote that playing around with import/export and moving addresses around between wallets may result in double-spends, which may result in corrupted wallets. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/195 for a solution",
