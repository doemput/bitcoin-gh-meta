Probably due to sending the block chain to fellow bitcoin users ( I had about 65 connections at the time )..\n\nThe ability to limit / throttle the network usage like most other p2p programs would be beneficial.  Otherwise I have to ensure I close the Bitcoin application to keep it from killing my upload.\n",
