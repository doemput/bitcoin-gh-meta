   "body" : "To be able to make an external GUI, I am working on modularizing bitcoin into a library. This push request is basic code plumbing, 100% no functional or build system changes.\r\n\r\n- Put guard statements around header files.\r\n\r\n- Removed macro foreach: conflicts with Qt4 keyword `foreach`, replaced with BOOST_FOREACH.\r\n\r\n- Prefix C++ stdlib structures and functions with std:: in headers; \"using namespace\" in header files is generally frowned upon because it 'infects' other files included after it. These are moved to the implementation files.\r\n\r\n- Modularity: `base48.h` and most other header files can now be included without the other shebang (useful for linking external GUI to bitcoin core, part of GUI separation). The include files that need each other, now include each other.\r\n",
