   "body" : "Remove send to IP transaction support, as it is insecure and would confuse users when used. \n\nAn IP is a terrible identifier as it does not identify a person or organization. Furthermore, man-in-the-middle attacks are trivial as the internet has no \"proof that you have ip XXX\" API. In the future address shortening services based on \"user@domain\" would be useful, but these will likely be based on third party APIs and not on this code.\n\n* Removes logic to accept transfers by IP\n* Removes UI logic to send transfers by IP (CSendingDialog). Entering an IP in the send box will always result in an error.\n\nDiscussion on forum: https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9334.0",
