If\r\none target tries to build while the other is halfway through writing the\r\n.mk, the make ends up in an undefined state.\r\n\r\nFix that by making one depend on the other. This also reorders the variables\r\nto be passed by param rather than via the environment, and combines the targets\r\ninto a single rule to avoid needless duplication.",
