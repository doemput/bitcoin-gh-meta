In theory, precise caches will be regenerated for subsequent PRs, but I'm nervous about that actually happening seamlessly on the deprecated platform.\r\n\r\nEven if it does work without issue, PRs will be slow until _something_ is pushed into master. When a PR is created, the build cache is taken from its source branch (master), and copied into the PR. From there, the PR updates its own cache with each update.\r\n\r\nRight now we have no master cache, and no PR caches. So until there's something to pull from master, each PR will be rebuilding from scratch. Also, once we _do_ pull the trigger on this, it will essentially invalidate all caches again, because all dependencies will be rebuilt for the new toolchains.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Need to push _something_ into master asap to avoid slow builds all day.
