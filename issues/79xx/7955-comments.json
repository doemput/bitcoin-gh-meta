(it's also computationally expensive even when fee filter is used).\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like is a \"TOPMEMPSYNC\", which is functionally equal to mempool but considers only the top 2*BLK_SIZE txn in 'fee-rate' order (actual order can be implementation defined but should approximate mining preferences), and also filters its output through setinventoryknown. Then you can pick a peer and keep pulling from it every block and get one more block worth of transactions one block ahead of needing them.",
