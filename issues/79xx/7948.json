   "body" : "This adds the hash of the first block of the LOCKED_IN period for a given deployment (when the deployment is LOCKED_IN or ACTIVE) to the `bip9_softforks` data of the `getblockchaininfo` RPC.\n\nI implemented this as a simple scan through the already existing map values to make this change easy to review. I looked at adding an array to the version bits cache struct and then populating it from the `THRESHOLD_LOCKED_IN` case in `AbstractThresholdConditionChecker::GetStateFor`, but that would have meant more refactoring.\n\nThe motivation for this is that I was researching some forking going on on testnet3 and one of the first questions I had was, \"When were the BIP9 forks locking in and activating?\" This patch provides the info necessary to begin digging around and figuring that out. This provides the lock in block. Take its height and then mentally add 2016 to get the ACTIVE block height etc... This was the simplest change to get the info I was after.\n",
