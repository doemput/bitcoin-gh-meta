   "body" : "addresses #7394 and some of #7902\r\n\r\nDisabling warnings can be tricky, because doing so can cause a different\r\ncompiler to create new warnings about unsupported disable flags. Also, some\r\nwarnings don't surface until they're paired with another warning (gcc). For\r\nexample, adding \"-Wno-foo\" won't cause any trouble, but if there's a legitimate\r\nwarning emitted, the \"unknown option -Wno-foo\" will show up as well.\r\n\r\nWork around this in 2 ways:\r\n\r\n1. When checking to see if -Wno-foo is supported, check for \"-Wfoo\" instead.\r\n2. Enable -Werror while checking 1.\r\n\r\nIf \"-Werror -Wfoo\" compiles, \"-Wno-foo\" is almost guaranteed to be supported.\r\n\r\n-Werror itself is also checked. If that fails to compile by itself, it likely\r\nmeans that the user added a flag that adds a warning. In that case, -Werror\r\nwon't be used while checking, and the build may be extra noisy. The user would\r\nneed to fix the bad input flag.\r\n\r\nAlso, silence 2 more additional warnings that can show up post-c++11.",
