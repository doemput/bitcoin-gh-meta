Over the last few days I've been experiencing several crashes reported as being due to not being able to read from the disk, so I decided to try reindexing.\r\n\r\nI tried to run the following command several times:\r\n> C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0>C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c start \"Bitcoin Core\" /LOW /MIN \"C:\\Program Files\\Utilities\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe\" -reindex\r\n\r\nI repeatedly encountered the following error message in a message box:\r\n\"Please check that your computer's date and time are correct. If your clock is wrong Bitcoin will not work properly.\"\r\nI tried to click OK but the box wouldn't go away, and the window greyed out. There appeared to be no CPU or disk usage. I terminated the program.\r\n\r\nThe following command did produce the same messagebox, but proceeded slightly further before popping it up - and more importantly, it actually went away when I clicked OK.\r\n> C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c start \"Bitcoin Core\" /LOW /MIN \"C:\\Program Files\\Utilities\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe\" -alert -reindex -disablewallet",
