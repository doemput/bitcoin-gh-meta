   "body" : "#### Reasons for another notification interface\n- Currently there is no interface that could be extended to \"private\" notification secured behind the authorization (like peers connected/disconnected or a new wallet relevant transaction notification)\n- HTTP long poll notifications are very easy to set up and require almost no dependencies\n- HTTP long poll notifications can easily pushed over the internet using httpd reverse proxy together with a popper authentication method (certs or http auth digest) together with TLS.\n- HTTP long poll would allow connecting applications to do all kinds of things with just a single communication channel (currently you need RPC & ZMQ for most use cases which would require VPN or a fancy multi port stunnel connection to broadcast the notification over the internet)\n#### How does it work\n- The listener calls the `pollnotification` RPC command.\n- If no notifications are available, the RPC thread will idle for a given timeout (30s by default)\n- If a notification was fired during the 30 seconds, the longpoll call will be responded with the new notification(s)\n- The client/listener can immediately reconnect and wait again\n- If notifications are already in the queue, the `pollnotification` command will immediately response.\n- Notifications can't get lost (possible to lose them during http transfer and if one exceed the queue limit)\n#### Downsides\n- JSON encoding overhead\n#### New RPC calls\n\n`setregisterednotifications [<notificationtype>]` (possible types are `hashtx` and `hashblock`)\n`getregisterednotifications`\n`pollnotifications`\n#### Missing\n- [ ] More tests\n- [ ] Documentation\n\nI'd like to use a such interface to work on a remote GUI (use case: GUI on your local desktop, node on a VPS).\n",
