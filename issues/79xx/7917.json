   "body" : "Several changes:\r\n* Make reindex/import use `AcceptBlock` rather than `ProcessNewBlock`, so activation of the resulting best chain is delayed.\r\n* That delayed activation is handled by the existing \"Activating best chain\" step in the startup process, which is moved to `ThreadImport`.\r\n* Optimize `ActivateBestChain` to not walk the entire chain to find the most work chain to connect for each block (O(n^2) -> O(n)).\r\n\r\nThis has several advantages:\r\n* As the actual activation is done after all blocks have been added back to the index, it gets to use the checkpoints information (better progress indicator, skipping of signature checks, ...).\r\n* Having a block index with many unactivated blocks (for example, after deleting the chainstate directory) becomes *much* faster\r\n* That case also runs in the background now (as it's simply treated as part of the importing process).\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n* All blocks are read twice from disk during reindex (once to rebuild the index, once to activate).\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- [x] Better progress indicator during the index rebuild phase.\r\n",
