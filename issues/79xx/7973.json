Sometimes incoming traffic is constantly around 100 KB/s randomly between one hour and ten minutes and GUI is lagging. Then lag stops and incoming traffic drops strongly below 100 KB/s line to about 10-20 KB/s. Node is fully synced (there are short bursts of incoming traffic above 100 KB/s), other settings are unchanged. Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 Windows version is used.\r\nEdit: There are less lags when `-maxmempool` is left to default 300.",
