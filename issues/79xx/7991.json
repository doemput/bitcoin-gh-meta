   "body" : "I profiled bitcoind's memory usage and noticed that the tx hashes as keys in `mapNextTx` are taking a large amount of space, but they're redundant since the corresponding value has a pointer to the `CTransaction` that has the hash in it. On a system with 64-bit pointers, replacing these hashes with pointers or references would, once the mempool warms up, save about 7% of total memory usage.\r\n\r\nI explored different ways of doing this.\r\n\r\nI ruled out `std::reference_wrapper` (possibly the most straightforward way of using references as keys in a map), because it's a big footgun and also the syntax for using it would be weird; you'd have to `static_cast<COutpoint&>(it->first)` to get the \"value\" of a key from an iterator.\r\n\r\nThe simplest approach I found was to use a `map<const COutPoint*, CInpoint, DereferencingComparator<const COutPoint*>>` -- but this also required strange syntax: `map.find(&outpoint)` is misleading, since the outpoints will be compared as values.\r\n\r\nThe implementation here is a refinement of the `DereferencingComparator` approach: I created `refmap` as a simple proxy to a map that has pointers as keys and uses the `DereferencingComparator`; `refmap` passes through all methods except those that normally take a comparison value, which it takes by const reference and gives the address to the underlying map. This allows a map to use pointers as keys, and:\r\n- compare keys by pointed-to value\r\n- insert keys or return them from the map as pointers (which makes clear to the map user the constraint on the lifetime of the pointed-to key object)\r\n- perform value lookups by reference as a normal map would (making it clear that keys are compared by value)",
