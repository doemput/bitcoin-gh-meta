      "body" : "Bitcoin is good at finding hardware problems because it moves relatively large amounts of data around and then it verifies that that data is intact.\r\n\r\nMost hard drives keep a log of certain kinds of errors, called the \"SMART\" status. I don't know a good way to check that on Windows though, not my area of experience. A lot of external HD enclosures don't enable access to SMART status info so if you may need to find an enclosure that works or directly attach it to a computer (either as a second drive, or booting the computer from a Linux LiveCD to do the testing if you're up for that). You can try it first though, if the enclosure doesn't work with SMART the disk checking tool will say it can't test the disk.",
