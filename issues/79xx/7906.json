For reference, https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/tree/net-refactor12 builds on top of these as well as #7868. The high-level purpose of this work is to encapsulate p2p functionality into a single class rather than scattered globals, so that It may be safely changed without worrying about side-effects.\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, I think these are all improvements in their own right. See individual commit messages for more info.",
