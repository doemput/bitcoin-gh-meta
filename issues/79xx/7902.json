   "body" : "Please forgive me if I'm not reporting this correctly -- I'm following directions generated by \"./configure\" and I've never reported an issue to github before...\r\n\r\nSoftware:\r\n   Mac OS X Version 10.6.8 Snow Leopard\r\nHardware:\r\n   2.66GHz Intel Core i7\r\n   4GB 1067 MHz DDR3\r\n\r\nI attempted to install the binary of Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 but it failed and said I'd need to update my OS before I could install the binary.  I am currently limited to Snow Leopard due to requirements for other projects, etc.  Therefore, I decided to try my hand at building from source.\r\n\r\nWhen I run \"./configure\", I receive the following errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  stdio.h: present but cannot be compiled\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  stdio.h:     check for missing prerequisite headers?\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  stdio.h: see the Autoconf documentation\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  stdio.h:     section \"Present But Cannot Be Compiled\"\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  stdio.h: proceeding with the compiler's result\r\nconfigure: WARNING:      ## -------------------------------------------------------- ##\r\nconfigure: WARNING:      ## Report this to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues ##\r\nconfigure: WARNING:      ## -------------------------------------------------------- ##\r\n\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  sys/select.h: present but cannot be compiled\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  sys/select.h:     check for missing prerequisite headers?\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  sys/select.h: see the Autoconf documentation\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  sys/select.h:     section \"Present But Cannot Be Compiled\"\r\nconfigure: WARNING:  sys/select.h: proceeding with the compiler's result\r\nconfigure: WARNING:      ## -------------------------------------------------------- ##\r\nconfigure: WARNING:      ## Report this to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues ##\r\nconfigure: WARNING:      ## -------------------------------------------------------- ##\r\n```\r\nThanks to all of you for the amazing work you do for the community, I don't know if there is a way for an official binary to still be available for Snow Leopard, but that too, would be greatly appreciated  =)  Or if someone wants to help me learn how to create the binary installer for Snow Leopard, perhaps I could contribute that back?  It is only difficult the first time, right?\r\n\r\nIf there is anything more you need from me, I'd be happy to help.  Please understand that you may have to help me help you because building from source is something that I have knowledge of, but not much understanding of.  I'm reasonably comfortable with the CLI, I just don't know if I can answer some questions you may have.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nblue-onyx\r\n",
