   "body" : "We've been quite successful in eliminating these lately (#7905, #7691). \n\nIt would be nice to disentangle the wallet and non-wallet initialization completely so that init.cpp no longer depends on the wallet (and thus, `libbitcoin_server.a` no longer depends on `libbitcoin_wallet.a` - the other way is fine, a circular dependency is not).\n\nIgnoring the GUI for now (which still needs some work in this direction), the following are left:\n- `init.cpp`: these are mostly self-contained and short.\n  - [x] print BerkeleyDB version should probably be moved to ~~`CWallet::InitLoadWallet`~~ `CWallet::Verify` (fixed in #8036).\n  - [x] wallet-specfic option interaction (`-walletbroadcast`, `-prune`+`-rescan`) should move to wallet module (possibly a new call that can be called in addition to `InitParameterInteraction()`)\n  - [x] printing setKeyPool size etc should probably be moved to `CWallet::InitLoadWallet`.\n  - [ ] wallet initialization/verify/shutdown - maybe this could be replaced by a general registration system for initialization/interrupt/shutdown functions, called as signals in the appropriate places. The same could be used by other modules\n  - [x] `-disablewallet` could result in the wallet not being registered at all, and that can all be handled from outside init.\n- RPC still has some calls that vary depending on wallet support. We should split these up. This is the more annoying part as it will involve API changes. No non-wallet RPC call should make an assumption about \"a wallet\".\n  - `rpcmisc.cpp`\n    - [ ] `getinfo` - this call is already on the list to be deprecated for a long time\n    - [ ] `validateaddress` - should be split up into an utility-only `validateaddress` and a wallet-specific call `getaddressinfo` (name open for discussion)\n    - [ ] `createmultisig` - same. `createmultisig` and `walletcreatemultisig` or so\n  - [ ] `rpcblockchain.cpp`\n    - [ ] `signrawtransaction` - should be split into an utility-only `signrawtransaction` and a wallet-specific call `walletsignrawtransaction`.\n- [ ] Mining: no `ENABLE_WALLET` but an implicit assumption and a circuitous registration system. The `generate` call should be a wallet-specific call, whereas `generatetoaddress` is core. See discussion in #6481.\n\nThe first phase would be to introduce the new (wallet-only) methods, then a release later remove wallet functionality from the core-only calls.\n",
