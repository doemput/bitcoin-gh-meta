   "body" : "Thanks to @pstratem for finding this.\r\n\r\nThe normal vector deserializer reads data in chunks of at most 5 MB, preventing OOM when insane vector lengths are encoded. This protection is not present in CScriptCompressor's specialized deserializer, however, resulting in a potential OOM when very large length descriptors exist, as the target CScript is resized before attempting to read that much data.\r\n\r\nHowever, CScripts have a maximum length above which they're always invalid. We can treat scriptPubKeys with such lengths as unspendable, preventing them from going into the UTXO set even, and skipping them when deserializing.\r\n\r\nNote that none of this is exposed to the network, as the P2P code uses normal (pre)vectors, which do have this OOM protection directly in serialize.h.",
