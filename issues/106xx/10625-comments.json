      "body" : "@sdaftuar Any thoughts on above?\r\n\r\nAfter sitting on this idea for a week, I realized this morning it has a pretty big flaw.\r\nThe whole point of the quick decay was to prevent mempool stuffing attacks causing artificially high fees for an extended period of time.  This idea would break that.\r\n\r\nBut do you think there is some middle ground?\r\nOr maybe it is ok if it's only used for conservative estimates?\r\n",

(For instance, do non-public nodes routinely see accurate mempool min fees or are they just never even receiving the transactions due to their peers mempool limiting?)\r\n\r\nClosing for now and maybe forever, you can remove the milestone.",
