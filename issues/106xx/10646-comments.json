      "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've a similar issue:\r\n\r\n**Describe the issue**\r\n\r\nWhen I opened the Bitcoin Core program, the GUI gets to \"Done loading\" and then hangs about 5 min. This was happening the last few days (v0.14.0). After continuing, it will start catching up/syncing (it is now 2 days behind). After a some time (I don't know exactly) the Bitcoin Core client freezes again, and it hangs indefenitly.\r\n\r\n**Can you reliably reproduce the issue?**\r\n\r\nYes. At this moment, after killing the unresponsive Bitcoin Core, it now behaves the same every time: start, verifying blocks, at the moment I see \"Done Loading\" it hangs about 5 minutes, then continues, starts catching up, and freezes again after ? minutes. Restarted the PC a few times, restarted Bitcoin Core about 6 times already.\r\nI've upgraded from v0.14.0 to v0.14.2, no change in the behaviour.\r\n\r\n**If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:**\r\n1.Open Bitcoin Core - \r\n2.Wait\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\n\r\nThe GUI should continue to be responsive. It should only say \"Done loading\" when its actually done loading (ie the main GUI should open immediately).\r\n\r\n**Actual behaviour**\r\n\r\nAbout 5 minutes after \"Done loading\" appears, the GUI locks up (Not responding listed in the task manager). The \"Done loading\" message remains there until the main GUI appears.\r\n\r\n**What version of bitcoin-core are you using?**\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core version v0.14.2 (64-bit), official\r\n\r\n**Machine specs:**\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢OS: Windows 8.1 64-bit\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢CPU: Intel Core i7 \r\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢RAM: 32 GB\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢Disk size: 4TB HD SATA 6GB/S (WD RED) with still 600GB free for the blockchain, 500 GB SSD for the program and other (smaller) data\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ¢Network Speed: 150 Mbps\r\n\r\n\r\n",
