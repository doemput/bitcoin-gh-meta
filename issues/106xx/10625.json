   "body" : "Volatility of fees required has increased significantly.\r\nEstimates already take a look at the mempool min fee and never return anything less than that.\r\nHowever the mempool min fee decays quite quickly, but I think it makes more sense to track a recent high for the mempool min fee and never return an estimate ~more~less than that.  Probably only when conservative = true.  Perhaps a history as long as 4 weeks?  \r\nMaybe we could just keep a rolling history of the max per day for each day over the last 4 weeks.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty easy change to make, just wanted to make a note, because I think it would be a good improvement to get in before 0.15.\r\n\r\n",
