   "body" : "Some people keep thinking that MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE is a separate\r\n size limit from the weight limit when it fact it is superfluous,\r\n and used in early tests before the witness data has been\r\n validated or just to compute worst case sizes.  The size checks\r\n that use it would not behave any differently consensus wise\r\n if they were eliminated completely.\r\n\r\nIts correct value is not independently settable but is a function\r\n of the weight limit and weight formula.\r\n\r\nThis patch just eliminates it and uses the scale factor as\r\n required to compute the worse case constants.  It's an alternative\r\n to another PR that adds a long comment that seemingly was still\r\n not sufficient.",
