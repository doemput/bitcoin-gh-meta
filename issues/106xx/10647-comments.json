Copying files only needs a small number of operations (each accessing large blobs of sequential bytes on disk). Block validation needs to access 1000s of small pieces, each of  which results in a separate operation. USB disks are very limited in their number of operations per second, regardless of how many bytes are affected. This is also what your debug information shows; it's the fetching of inputs (the connect step in the log) which takes long, while signature validation is instant after that.\n\nI would strongly suggest running database on an internal disk, and either run in pruning mode, or just put the blocks on the external disk, but not the database.",

Why would USB disks be limited to operations per second? I get the feeling that either you're dumbing this down for me, or its just not accurate. The closest thing I can think you mean is that each disk access on a hard disk (regardless of whether its USB or not) requires moving the read head, which is kind of a geological-time operation in comparison to your CPU. Is this what you mean? \r\n\r\n> Block validation needs to access 1000s of small pieces\r\n\r\nYa, but I would have thought the software would store it so it can still grab large blocks to put into memory, then grab each small piece from memory, rather than trying to random-access every little bit from the disk. \r\n\r\n> just put the blocks on the external disk, but not the database.\r\n\r\nHow do I do this?

Since the pieces of data we need to fetch for validation are only a few hundred bytes, each read tends to result in an independent fetch from disk.\n\nAs for how to move the database without moving blocks: In Linux, you can use a symlink to another directory for the $DATADIR/blocks directory.

How big is the database?\r\n* Have separate options (that you can set in the bitcoin options in the GUI) for location of the database vs the raw blockchain\r\n* Organize data on-disk so that single large sequential reads can gather multiple (hundreds) of the pieces of data needed for validation all at once and then run through them sequentially from memory.\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm surprised these sorts of optimizations aren't already done. Should I create a new issue for these optimizations? Who can comment on which of these would actually help performance or what other optimizations would be critical for this kind of issue? \r\n\r\nIts gonna start getting a ton more important to optimize this for external HD usage as the blockchain grows. Top of the line laptops still come with a baseline 256GB SSDs, and a 120GB blockchain is already straining the space on those things (+ OS and programs and games). And some people don't have top of the line laptops.. ",

Plus it reserves some of the dbcache for the time when flushes happen, to prevent briefly spike and make you run out of memory. This slack space is significantly reduced in 0.15; you're free to try master if you want to see if it improves things.\r\n\r\nThe database is stored in a special compact format on disk. When loaded into memory it's done an quickly-accessible way that is several times larger than the disk version. Loading the whole thing in memory needs around 8 GB.\r\n\r\nThere could perhaps be an option to load the whole database into memory at startup to speed things up later if you actually have that much dbcache configured.... but if not, you're still stuck with loading the bits and pieces as they are used, and slow disks will keep slowing you down.\r\n\r\n> Have separate options (that you can set in the bitcoin options in the GUI) for location of the database vs the raw blockchain\r\n\r\nYes, this would be possible.\r\n\r\n> Organize data on-disk so that single large sequential reads can gather multiple (hundreds) of the pieces of data needed for validation all at once and then run through them sequentially from memory.\r\n\r\nWe can't predict what pieces will be needed.

Would it be possible to sort it by something more useful to blockchain validation? \r\n\r\nOk, so I attempted to symlink the `blocks` directory from my SSD to my external HD (which are both using NTFS). I copied the data directory (minus the blocks directory) to my SSD, cd'd in there and did:\r\n\r\n`mklink /D blocks H:\\Bitcoin\\blocks`\r\n\r\nI can confirm that its moving about 6 times as fast now. Where it was telling me 3 days til I'm synced, now its saying 12 hours. So a huge speed up! Not as much of a speed up as I had hoped, but the client is now using over 650MB of memory and 5-6 Mbps of network bandwidth (that last being relatively consistent with the 4x speedup). Also, the client starts up a ton faster (not a lot of waiting at \"Done loading\" anymore).\r\n\r\nSo thanks @sipa for helping me figure this out! Anything else I might be able to do to make it go any faster? \r\n\r\n",
