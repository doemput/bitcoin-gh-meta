This I believe really needs to be heard, even the fact you have instantly said that it does need activating will instantly make a difference to the public. Media are dangerous and this sort of public, transparent conversation, about an 'Issue' with Bitcoin is really needed. SegWit and Scaling are serious issues that are being addressed, but only being reported by media, we can change that by simply leaving this 'Issue' open.",
