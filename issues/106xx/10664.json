I run a full node bitcoin core in a raspberry-pi-like device, the synchronization stop and server gone away after a short time running.\r\n\r\nI have a device called cubie board, it is similar to raspberry-pi, a small computer model. with 2G RAM and 8G ROM, and I mount a 350G hard disk as the main folder for bitcoin-core, I download the arm version and run in it.\r\n\r\nthe first time, I run the software for the synchronization, when the datachain reach around 40G, the server stop for unknown reason. I type ./bitcoind -daemon and start the server again. however it stop, I run the \"top\" in the termination and watch, the progress of bitcoind just show for a while, and then disappear.\r\n\r\nI delete all the data inside the ~./bitcoin folder, and start over. this time, the phenomenon happened again when the datachain size reach around 65G.\r\n\r\nI don't know why this happened, And I don't know whether this happened in others computer. I cannot find the answer on the internet, like goole or baidu [a web search engine in China], most of the results I searched via the goole or baidu are how to make money with bitcoin or how to do a wish vestment with bitcoin, very few tech answer about my problem.\r\n\r\nSo. it is very appreciated if someone can help me with it!!",
