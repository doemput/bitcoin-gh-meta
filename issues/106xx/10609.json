   "body" : "I'd very much appreciate the (RPC) command getrawtransaction to work on a pruned node. When I browse the rawmempool or the last X blocks, I'd love to be able to find out about what's gone on in these blocks. \r\n\r\nI have not tried pruning my node to test getrawtransaction but I've read that the txindex (needed for getrawtransaction) is incompatible with getrawtransaction. Why? \r\n\r\nLogically speaking I'd think I could browse and decode the X blocks (and transactions) that I do have stored. And if the block or transaction is not in my local database, could it not tell me something like: \"this block does either not exist or it is not in your pruned version of the database\"\r\n\r\nMaybe there can be a prunedtxindex option or perhaps txindex can be made compatible with the pruned option. \r\n\r\nPlease tell me if this is technically possible or if it is not (if say old blocks need to be queried to decode a raw transaction)",
