I'm just simply using sendmany to multiple addresses. \r\nIt created a few transactions with 2000+ sat/byte, used settxfee specifically and txconfirmtarget=4. It usually creates transaction correctly with change and the correct fee, so in my case the same behavior as the OP.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me as it ate the rest of the change for the fee in all cases. My inputs vary widely in size, there are usually a few inputs less than 0.05 for it to choose from when building it, usually from existing change. 80% of the time it usually comes up with an input set that is within ~0.01 of the output sum plus fee. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, occasionally sendtoaddress would send with a fee a bit higher than I expected, decided to try sendmany to reduce fees and combine individual sends into a single transaction.\r\n\r\nUsing this in a production environment, not expecting bitcoin core to have issues like this.",
