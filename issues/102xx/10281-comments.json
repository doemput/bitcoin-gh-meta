Afterwards, you can use `upstream-pull/NUMBER/head` in arguments to `git show`,\n   `git checkout` and anywhere a commit id would be acceptable to see the changes from pull request NUMBER.\n+\n+RPC interface guidelines\n+--------------------------\n+\n+A few guidelines for introducing and reviewing new RPC interfaces:\n+\n+- Method naming: use consecutive lower-case names such as `getrawtransaction` and `submitblock`\n+\n+  - *Rationale*: Consistency with existing interface.\n+\n+- Argument naming: use snake case `fee_delta` (and not, e.g. camel case `feeDelta`)\n+\n+  - *Rationale*: Consistency with existing interface.\n+\n+- Use the JSON parser for parsing, don't manually parse integers or strings from\n+  arguments unless absolutely necessary.\n+\n+  - *Rationale*: Introduces hand-rolled string manipulation code at both the caller and callee sites,\n+    which is error prone, and it is easy to get things such as escaping wrong.\n+    JSON already supports nested data structures, no need to re-invent the wheel.\n+\n+  - *Exception*: AmountToValue can parse amounts as string. This was introduced because many JSON\n+    parsers and formatters hard-code handling decimal numbers as floating point\n+    values, resulting in potential loss of precision. This is unacceptable for\n+    monetary values. **Always** use `AmountToValue` and `ValueToAmount` when\n+    inputting or outputting monetary values. The only exceptions to this are\n+    `prioritisetransaction` and `getblocktemplate` because their interface\n+    is specified as-is in BIP22.\n+\n+- Missing arguments and 'null' should be treated the same: as default values. If there is no\n+  default value, both cases should fail in the same way.\n+\n+  - *Rationale*: Avoids surprises when switching to name-based arguments. Missing name-based arguments\n+  are passed as 'null'.\n+\n+  - *Exception*: Many legacy exceptions to this exist, one of the worst ones is\n+    `getbalance` which follows a completely different code path based on the\n+    number of arguments. We are still in the process of cleaning these up. Do not introduce\n+    new ones.\n+\n+- Try not to overload methods on argument type. E.g. don't make `getblock(true)` and `getblock(\"hash\")`\n+  do different things.\n+\n+  - *Rationale*: This is impossible to use with `bitcoin-cli`, and can be surprising to users.\n+\n+  - *Exception*: Some RPC calls can take both an `int` and `bool`, most notably when a bool was switched\n+    to a multi-value, or due to other historical reasons. **Always** have false map to 0 and\n+    true to 1 in this case.",
