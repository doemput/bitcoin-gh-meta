If you find\n+that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several\n+months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something\n+about:\n+\n+  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,\n+    only bug reports are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,\n+    it will be disregarded until the release is over. Wait for release.\n+  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than\n+    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your\n+    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change\n+    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take\n+    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting\n+    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md),\n+    is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc. Identify and address any of the\n+    issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give their opinion on the concept\n+    itself.\n+  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people\n+    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who\n+    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply",
