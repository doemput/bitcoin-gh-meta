Maybe because they're scared it might break if they do anything or they're just plain lazy.\r\n\r\nForcing them to go in and set a parameter to keep it running is a good incentive for them to upgrade the software, as they now no doubt realize they're running a node that is too old to be recommended by the developers.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, a warning message would most likely not only be ignored, but probably never be seen by the type of node runner mentioned above. Turning safe mode off may be a great middle ground, though.",
