The files that are not changed by bitcoind are linked, the rest is copied. Files not necessary for this (such as the wallet, debug log, etc) are not copied.\r\nThis copy of the data directory can be pruned at will, then copied, or simply deleted without adverse effect on the original datadir.\r\n",
