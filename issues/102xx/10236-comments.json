Though, append only maybe no longer be always efficient (since `abandontransaction` we do update single-property wtx state).\r\n\r\nOthers have discussed about switching to sqlite, which IMO is reasonable for the transactions and maybe the pubkey cache.\r\n\r\nFor HD wallets, we could probably store the 256bit seed material as Bech32 together with the used-keypath-scheme in a single file that only gets written once. Then maybe use a form of @sipa's logdb as wtx/pubkey storage.\r\n\r\nThe path to that would be to abstract the database interface first (in order to allow BerkleyDB and LogDb the same time [to allow smooth migrations]).\r\n\r\nWe already made some baby-steps (#9256, #9143, #9142), next one would be #9951.",

This seems like a major inefficiency.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: despite the name, ThreadFlushWalletDB was not actually a flush thread.\r\n\r\nWhat does the actual fsyncing I'm talking about in the blog post is the destructor of CWalletDB if the constructur was called with `_fFlushOnClose = true`.\r\n\r\n`ThreadFlushWalletDB` doesn't exist anymore in master. It now is scheduled by `CScheduler` and has the more suitable name `MaybeCompactWalletDB`. \r\n\r\nBut more importantly: Compacting the database is not required to \"safely update\" the database. The only reason for doing it is to keep the database contained to one file most of the time.\r\nNormally a bdb database consists of a `.dat` file and a directory with log files that contain uncompacted updates to it. But this was deemed confusing for users, a long time ago.\r\n\r\nIf you don't care about that you could (AFAIK!) safely disable that periodic compaction.\r\n\r\n> I've been struggling with this issue of ever increasing hard drive use as wallet size grows for years now, but only recently discovered the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nThis one I don't understand - why would compaction result in a larger file?
