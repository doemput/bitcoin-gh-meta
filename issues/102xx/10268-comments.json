In this case, Travis doesn't fail because it's building bitcoin in a distdir, which does include all the test and config files in test/functional.\r\n\r\n#10307 should fix this by passing a new --configfile parameter from the test_runner to the individual tests. I've tested locally on an out-of-tree build and it seems to work.",
