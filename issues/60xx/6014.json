   "body" : "I've brought this previous pull request up to date and defined a new use case for it https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4687 .\r\n\r\n    This option is useful for mining pools that want faster block propagation.\r\n    Outbound connections will statistically have better overall network connectivity\r\n    than incoming connections. This is due to most nodes that accept these\r\n    outbound connections supporting a maximum of 125 connections.\r\n    Inbound connections are often NAT restricted and will then only support 8\r\n    connections. These NAT restricted connections are less desirable for pools.\r\n    This can be demonstrated using the following example of a pool with 125 connections.\r\n    This example makes the assumption that inbound connections are NAT restricted and \r\n    limited to 8 connections while outbound connections connect to nodes with the\r\n    default connection limit of 125.\r\n    Connection capacity within one hop of pool with default settings:\r\n    (8 outbound connections * 125 connections per node) +\r\n    (117 incoming connections * 8 connections per node) =\r\n    1936 Connections within one hop of the pool server\r\n    (125 outbound connections * 125 connections per node) =\r\n    15625 Connections within one hop of the pool server\r\n    Based off of these calculations a pool server can have about 8 times the\r\n    overall network connections within one hop while establishing\r\n    the same amount of connections itself. In reality it will likely be even more\r\n    due to the bitcoin network having far more available connections slots on nodes\r\n    than there are nodes trying to connect to those slots.\r\n    This setting should only be used by pool operators.",
