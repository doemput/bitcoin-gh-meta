   "body" : "@jonasschnelli The first commit should fix the asyncore issue you encountered.  I investigated what happens inside asyncore when it uses select instead of poll, and the bug is a subtle race condition: it appears to me that it's not safe to call ```close()``` while ```asyncore.loop()``` is running when using ```select()```.   Merely increasing the timeout would only reduce the likelihood of the bug triggering, not eliminate it, so instead I reworked the disconnect logic to happen outside of ```asyncore.loop()``` to eliminate that bug altogether.\r\n\r\nThe second commit takes ```invalidblockrequest.py``` out of travis until I am able to offer up a proper fix to a different race condition that could cause that test to spuriously fail -- that should be soon, but I worry that this could break travis for people in the meantime.  Thanks again @jonasschnelli for reporting this in  #5981.",
