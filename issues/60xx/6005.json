   "body" : "For those that have missed [this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3240ro/im_now_funding_all_the_devs_in_the_world_who_are/): it is now possible to directly reward the devs that participate in this (and other) repo(s) based on actual participation levels. The r/bitcoin community already donated so as a courtesy to them, please accept their support. The donations can be [found and claimed here](https://mobbr.com/#/task/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2JpdGNvaW4vYml0Y29pbg==). Those that have public email addresses have received mail, those that have not need to be notified by other means, such as this.\r\n\r\n### Claiming your share\r\n\r\n[Sign up](https://mobbr.com/#/join) to the platform, goto to -> `settings` -> `authenticated ID's` [here](https://mobbr.com/#/settings/ids) and authenticate your Github account (by OAUTH). The reward will be in your Mobbr wallet. Short explainer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ2beq1hBwE).\r\n\r\n### Some explanation on how the rewards are divided\r\n\r\nOn Github only a few types of participation are measured/rated. In that regard it is not a very social platform (yet). Our current algorithm uses those statistics to distribute rewards among participants. Instead of just using LOC, the algorithm weighs: \r\n- the number of commits accepted into main branch\r\n- number of lines added\r\n- number of lines deleted\r\n- recentness of a contribution. \r\n\r\nIt does some normalisation to reduce extremes. Not perfect, but generally fair enough to be useable. 'Kinda mostly reasonable...' as [Gavin said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3240ro/im_now_funding_all_the_devs_in_the_world_who_are/cq82k0l). \r\n\r\nRemember that repos are moderated by means of pull-request. So there is quality control before the algorithm does its thing. Ideally Github should measure more types of participation and have additional mechanisms and more 'passive factors' (like voting). This would make the algorithm more optimal.\r\n\r\nWe are open to suggestions on perfecting the algorithm, but in the end this part should be implemented in the collaboration platform itself, not on our end. We can imagine having a dashboard to tune the algorithm to the needs of the project. This would make social collaboration steerable.\r\n\r\n### crowdfunding issues and milestones\r\n\r\nIt is possible to pay repo's, issues and milestones. As long as the issues or milestones are still open, they are being crowdfunded. Once they are closed, the funds are distributed. These options can be used to allow crowds to 'vote' on features, by means of donations. Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------- list of contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n![mobbr crowdpayment system](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/701331/7105097/d6af2990-e107-11e4-9a5b-07a231c1f780.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
