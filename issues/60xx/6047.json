   "body" : "Libsecp256k1 now has explicit context objects, which makes it completely thread-safe. In turn, keep an explicit context object in key.cpp, which is explicitly initialized destroyed. This is not really pretty now, but it's more efficient than the static initialized object in key.cpp (which made for example bitcoin-tx slow, as for most of its calls, libsecp256k1 wasn't actually needed).\r\n\r\nThis also brings in the new blinding support in libsecp256k1. By passing in a random seed, temporary variables during the elliptic curve computations are altered, in such a way that if an attacker does not know the blind, observing the internal operations leaks even less information about the keys used. This was implemented by Greg Maxwell.\r\n",
