I didn't ask yet our technicians, firstly I would like to have your opinion about it. I turned off the wallet immediately (after first confirmation) when i saw that in Blockchain.org the value is completely different. I'm more a Bitcoin investor than a Bitcoin programmer, but I take care seriously about security on my computers.  \r\n\r\nDoes have anyone an idea what is it (an error in Blockchain or a theft) and what to do with it? \r\n![transaction-on-the-wallet-clear](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10259280/7425228/4602cdf2-efad-11e4-81fb-d88a14eb9b21.png)",
