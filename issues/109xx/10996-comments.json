Giving an error if regtest/testnet is specified in network.conf would probably be better, but seems like it violates the abstraction layer a fair bit...)",

It doesn't look to me like there's really much difficulty in combining the two patches either once one or the other gets merged (I'm not seeing much room for either to get much simpler, though -- you still have to finish loading bitcoin.conf then load the chain params to work out which network you're on before you can load the right network.conf).",
