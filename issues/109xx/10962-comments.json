As long as you consider the command line options at least. The GUI\nmessages themselves are usually ok.\n\nThis is why I'd prefer (and I'm sure many translators want too) to remove\nthe translation bit from command line options.\n\nThe other option would be to be much more strict about option help, but\nhonestly I don't see that happening - it has shown to be impossible to word\nthese non-technically.\n\n(That discardfee message was reworded and I immediately got new complaints\nabout it!
