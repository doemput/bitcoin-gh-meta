Linux distros will probably set them to \"-O2\" by default to reduce the object size. Gentoo will have some value set by the user's flags. Etc. All of those would end up with quietly disabled crc optimizations.\r\n\r\nInstead, I think we should just enable this flags if they work, possibly behind configure switches.\r\n\r\nFor 0.15, I propose that we just keep it simple and always check for sse42, and punt worrying about the warnings until 0.16.",
