   "body" : "The \"-vbignore=bit:start:end\" option can be used to prevent bitcoin\r\nfrom alerting the user of known but uninteresting proposed upgrades\r\nthat are being signalled via the version field.\r\n\r\nThis hopefully provides the feature requested in issue #8266, allow version bits to have an \"ignore button\". It requires specifying start and end times rather than a final block height, which should map better to BIP 9 implementations. It also allows multiple deployments on a single bit to be ignored independently -- if the bit is used in between any deployments, it will still generate warnings.\r\n\r\nThis setting will also avoid the bit from triggering the \"Unknown block versions being mined\" warning during the set period.",
