   "body" : "This PR adds a segsignal compatible rule that all blocks after block 477120 (segsignal's activation height) must signal for segwit so long as segwit is still in the `started` state. This will make sure that miners are enforcing the rules that they have chosen to activate.\r\n\r\nThis PR is on the 0.14 branch so that a 0.14.3 release can be quickly made which includes this change. It can also be easily rebased onto master if needed.",
