It looks like you're missing the `boost` dependency.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to install all of the dependencies for Fedora at: [build-unix.md#dependency-build-instructions-fedora](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md#dependency-build-instructions-fedora)\r\n\r\nYou may need to install `dnf` first:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo yum install epel-release\r\nsudo yum install dnf\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen install the dependencies from \"Dependency Build Instructions: Fedora\" and through \"Berkely DB\". Boost itself gets installed in the dependencies section, so you won't need to compile it from source.\r\n\r\nOnce the dependencies are installed, scroll back up and go through the build process again.",
