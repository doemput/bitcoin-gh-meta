   "body" : "Don't force IRC off if not listening, do force it off if IPv4 is off.\n\nPreviously Bitcoin would refuse to use IRC if it was either not\naccepting inbound connections or not making outbound. Instead this\nchanges it to not use IRC only if it's not doing either or if\nIPv4 is off completely. If Bitcoin is not listening this will use\nthe default random nicks rather than the IP based ones.\n\nAlso,\n\nDon't retry a failing IRC nickname forever.\n\nIf our IRC nick is in use (because some other node thinks it has\nthe same address we think we have) don't fruitlessly try to reconnect\nusing that name forever. After three tries, give up and use a random\nnick. Either we'll learn a new local address from IRC and switch\nto that, or it was right and the other guy is advertising for us.\n\nThis avoids a pessimal case where a second testnet node behind\na nat is unable to get any peers because he can't get on IRC.",
