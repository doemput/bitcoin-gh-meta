Additionally, ampersands/hotkeys seem to keep getting escaped.\n\nThese commits correct some of these issues, but I only got about 20% through the full recovery of old translations so far. This process is very time consuming, and I want to verify it will be accepted upstream before I spend any more time on it.\n\nI'm aware of Transifex, but I am automating a significant amount of the restoration process (for the most part, my time/effort is just checking the script's work for correctness). Hope these ts files can be imported to it...",
