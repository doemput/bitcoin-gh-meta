Ideally it ought to be something that allows likes/dislikes (as GitHub already has) to previous suggestions - doesn't rely on everyone being present at the same time - and ideally allows for threaded conversations and sub-topics to occur, yet allowing for an overall agenda to persist, perhaps with options to vote on proposals and keep a tally of votes, as well as the membership/status of participants (GitHub also already does this).\r\n\r\nOverall, given the criteria I am inclined to think GitHub may already be the best venue, but I do hope that others can agree that a venue that allows participants from varying timezones and allows inclusion of non-core participants for non-core issues is desirable.\r\n\r\nSo, this is two issues really - a better venue for bitcoin core discussion, and a better venue for overall bitcoin development discussion.",
