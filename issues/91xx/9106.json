   "body" : "When I run `estimatefee 1` right now, I get `-1` as the reply, meaning that it isn't possible to get a 95% chance of inclusion in the next block no matter what fee I include, but based on the collected mempool stats that isn't true.\r\n\r\nI traced the `TxConfirmStats::EstimateMedianVal()` call to see what was happening. It went like this:\r\n\r\nIn order to get \"enough transaction data points in this range of buckets\", it first grouped buckets 97 through 75 inclusive, found that their average confirm probability was 94.45% (below the 95% threshold), and so hit the `break` and stopped looking further.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that if it had looked at bucket 74 it would have had enough data points on its own, and would have had a probability of 95.51%, and so we could have returned a value of around 0.01 BTC.\r\n\r\nSo I'm seeing a 94.45% chance of confirmation in the next block if the fee is 0.01156269 or more per kB, and a 95.51% chance if the fee is in the range 0.01051153 - 0.01156269 per kB.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the code makes the assumption that higher fees always result in a higher probability, but that isn't actually the case.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be better to start at the cheapest bucket and work upwards, stopping at the first one that has a high enough probability, rather than stopping as soon as we find an expensive bucket with too low a probability? Otherwise it is possible for a small miner to sabotage fee estimation by targeting just one bucket. If he has 5% of the hash rate and refuses to confirm transactions in a particular expensive (0.01 BTC per kB) bucket he will ensure that the search stops at that bucket for all `estimatefee 1` calls. He can create enough such transactions to make the bucket statistically significant for less than 1 BTC per day which causing almost 'unlimited' damage to the usefulness of `estimatefee 1`.\r\n\r\nAlso, isn't 95% too high of a threshold when we see almost that many empty or nearly empty blocks? If I lower the threshold to 90% I see a much more reasonable result, of around 0.0006 BTC per kB for next-block confirmation. In [his original email](http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg06405.html) Alex wrote:\r\n\r\n> Since even the highest fee transactions are confirmed within the first block only 90-93% of the time, I decided to use 80% as my cutoff.\r\n\r\nThat seems like a reasonable argument. Why was the number [later changed from 85% to 95%](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f22ac4)?",
