However, I am aware that there is significant resistance currently (viaBTC) for reasons I do not understand, but nevertheless this warrants additional solutions in parallel with SegWit, that yet keep in line with Core values (i.e. no hard forks - even though I do not quite understand this rationale either).\r\n\r\nThe other solution i am aware of is a soft-fork that can make use of the difficulty recalculation bug - i.e. if sufficient miners agree on this solution (perhaps more will agree on this more readily than SegWit as as it is far simpler and therefore transparent) then it will allow bitcoins to be scaled very easily, without risking a fork (hard-fork). I realise Vitalik who proposed this didn't give the solution much merit, but given it's simplicity I think it may have more merit than many have realised. Is this solution worth any further consideration? (fuller details of the solution here: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/428tjl/softforking_the_block_time_to_2_min_my_primarily/)",
