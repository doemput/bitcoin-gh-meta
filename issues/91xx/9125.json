   "body" : "This is another preparation for #8580, avoiding performance problems and large code changes ahead of time (I was originally planning to do these afterwards, but that would temporarily introduce extra complexity).\r\n\r\nIn many places we've started using `std::shared_ptr<const CTransaction>` instead of `CTransaction` itself, as transactions are shared between many data structures (orphan pool, mempool, relay pool, partially-reconstructed transactions, ...), but a notable exception was `CBlock`, which so far always required a full copy in and out. If CTransaction is to become immutable, that will make things even worse when modifying the coinbase (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8580#issuecomment-243052533).\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n* The mining code no longer needs to create a deep copy of all transactions; the resulting CBlockTemplate just shares transactions with the mempool they're taken from.\r\n* Compact block reconstruction no longer copies transactions (not from the prefilled structure to the internal partial block, and not from the partial block to the full block).\r\n* Block processing no longer copies full transactions to txChanged.\r\n* CTransaction becomes constructable-from-serialization, preparing for #8580.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n* An extra pointer indirection and atomic increments/decrements in some places.\r\n\r\n",
