These existing CheckFinalTx checks are cheaper but still contribute to complication.  Maybe we can just remove them all?  \r\n\r\nOr if we do want to support them, then maybe there is an efficient and general way we can support finality checks for both types of locks.  Such as caching the time/height that the tx will be final and in the case of sequence locks, the hash that needs to remain on the main chain for that calculation to still be valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Although non-final handling may make sense when the GUI, some day, allows producing transactions that are not final yet.
