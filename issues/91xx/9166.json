Some old TXs in that `wallet.dat` contain comments with non-ASCII chars encoded as **latin1**.\r\n\r\nIn this case it's the German Umlaut **ÃÂ¼** encoded as `0xFC` (latin1) instead of `0xC3BC` (UTF8).\r\n\r\n`bitcoind` passes the comment in it's JSON response to `bitcoin-cli` without transformation, so the parser in `bitcoin-cli` complains about the latin1 representation of that character.\r\n\r\nJSON must to be used with UTF8 encoding.\r\n\r\ntcpdump confirms that the problem only occurs with TXs with non-utf8 special chars in their comments.\r\n\r\nSkipping the TXs with the problematic comments works fine:\r\n\r\n> % bitcoin-cli listtransactions '*' 1 2\r\n> (...)\r\n\r\n### Does dumping wallet.dat with `db_dump`, modifying the dump file and `db_load` work as a workaround?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nStop `bitcoind`, make a **backup** of your `wallet.dat` file.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb_dump -p -f dump.txt wallet.dat\r\ngrep -F comment dump.txt | perl -p -e 's#^.*comment(.*?)\\\\0b.*$#$1#'\r\n# this will output all your TX comments to inspect visually before modifying\r\nvim dump.txt\r\ndb_load -f dump.txt new.dat\r\nmv wallet.dat wallet.dat.orig\r\nmv new.dat wallet.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem: `grep` from above doesn't find all your comments. So there might still be comments left with latin1-encoded chars.\r\n\r\nMake 100% sure to replace the special chars only in your comments. Do not use search/replace! Replace each 1 byte char with exactly 1 byte ASCI char.\r\n\r\nIn my case I replaced `\\fc` with `u` (German `ÃÂ¼` --> `u`)\r\n\r\nIf you change the length of the string by replacing one special char with more than 1 char, you will get errors like the following on next start of `bitcoind`:\r\n\r\n> 2016-11-15 17:29:55 init message: Loading wallet...\r\n> Warning: Error reading wallet.dat! All keys read correctly,\r\n> but transaction data or address book entries might be missing or incorrect.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to handle this?",
