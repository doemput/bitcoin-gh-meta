      "body" : "On the db_dump/db_load error, I think this would have to be caused by an accidental `\\fc` -> `_` replacement in a part of the dump that wasn't an address name. I don't know how many replacements you had to make, but if it was not too many, I might try visually inspecting a diff of the dump file before and after the replacements, or maybe just starting with a few replacements and then adding more so you can identify which one(s) cause the warning. Also if there aren't too many transactions, it might be easier to use the wallet gui interface to change the address labels rather than work with dump/load.\r\n\r\nOn the underlying bug which caused latin1 to be stored in the database rather than utf8, it looks like it was fixed in 2011 with the `setCodecForCStrings` call added here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3f0816e3d926e0ea78ac7b6cd43efe62355885c8#diff-8c9d79ba40bf702f01685008550ac100R116\r\n\r\nOne improvement that might be a good idea to make now would be to have `UniValue::setStr` validate that strings passed to it are utf8. There actually already is utf8 validation code in the UniValue library (used during parsing), but it just isn't called right now by `UniValue::setStr`. Changing this could ensure that bitcoin never outputs invalid JSON, and make bugs like this one easier to track down and fix.",

It shouldn't do its own hidden munging of data. In this case it may make sense to have a two-pronged approach:\r\n\r\n- Make univalue validate strings as unicode, raise an exception if not.\r\n\r\n- Make sure bitcoind never feeds it invalid unicode. This means strings read from the wallet database will need to be sanitized. I don't think we have any other un-sanitized sources of strings that are reported on RPC (e.g. \"user agent\" strings from the network are already sanitized in an extremely strict way.)\r\n  - It should already be impossible for new non-unicode strings to get into the database, as unicode is checked on parsing the incoming JSON. So at least there will be no new cases.",
