   "body" : "https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/hard-fork-policy\r\n\r\nThis page seems to be misleading - it seems to suggest that \"hard forks\" are in some way worse than \"soft forks\" when it seems to me that the opposite is true. This conclusion has also been reached by other bitcoin developers. Can this page be clarified? Can \"contentious\" be defined, for example? \r\n\r\nSoft forks are being proposed as bad because it makes it harder (if not impossible) for older nods to audit correctly - i.e. it intentionally creates a way for invalid transactions to appear valid to older software thereby taking away their ability to detect that they need to upgrade or change their rules. Hard forks on the other hand provide more \"informed consent\" being more transparent about a change in protocol.\r\n\r\nThis arguments above (also made by other developers) seem quite logical and persuasive, and therefore if Core has equally strong logical arguments for soft forks being better/preferable, then I think the opportunity is currently being missed to put these forward in the current web page.",
