This has been changed so the fee is now only output if all inputs meet the required filter.   I believe this is a strict improvement from current behavior.  The suggestion to try to output fees based on whether or not its possible to calculate the correct fee seems a bit of a half measure, and that a future PR could go all the way to saving require stated to always know the fee (as has been previously discussed).\r\n\r\nAll valid transactions have vin.size() > 0, so I'm not worried about the `IsAllFromMe` defaulting to true.  Certainly any transaction with vin.size() == 0 couldn't be in the mempool and therefore couldn't pass `IsTrusted` anyway.",
