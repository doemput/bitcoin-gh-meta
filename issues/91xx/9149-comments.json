The place for this is probably the bitcoin-dev mailing list.\r\n\r\nThe current time-slot has been chosen after asking and arranging with every interested participant finding the best slot that could work for most interested participants. Sure, we can (and probably should) re-evaluate a better, different time-slot every here and there (maybe once every year).\r\nBut my feeling tells me, that changing the timeslot will make things difficult for some.\r\n\r\nThe public IRC meeting is hold in #bitcoin-core-dev (just because it's most convenient there).\r\n\r\nIMO there are already various forums to discuss stuff (ex. https://bitcointalk.org).",

However, the minutes/summary of the meeting is always made available at bitcoincore.org. In the final analysis, there is no utilitarian outcome in me synchronously participating in the meeting because the matters being discussed, though interesting, are beyond my capacity as a hobbyist to influence or sway.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to you, since your repeated failure to make meaningful contribution to this project means you also lack the merit and reputation to influence the course of Core development.\r\n\r\nPlease put a plug in the constant revisitation of old issues and public questions you should correctly be researching on your own.",

This isn't really the place to discuss further the \"non-issues\" you refer to. My intention has always been to make bitcoin better, and if I raise an issue it's because I think it's an issue - this is presumably the same reason other people open issues. Subjectivity leads to non-consensus. It's incorrect to suggest either of us has no influence - your post above getting four thumbs-up proves you have influence, and some of my issues raised are considered issues - I am still learning how to determine in advance whether something I consider to be an issue will be considered to be an issue by other people. Please, let's not encourage school-yard behavior on here by dissing people in order to gain favor with others.",
