I'll accept lashings as penance...\r\n\r\nWill rebase #5882 after merge.\r\n\r\nBroken hash logic caused all depends on some platforms (osx at least) to end up with the same build-id. Without this fix, nothing will be rebuilt when recipes or dependencies change. The 'cut' was put in the wrong place, so rather than hashing the hashes, it hashed the filename which was always \"-\" (stdin). Probably a stupid c/p mistake. ",
