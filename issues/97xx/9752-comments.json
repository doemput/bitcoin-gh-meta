The risk if one of them is maliated and there's a lot of wasted relay?\r\n\r\n There's certain times it's pretty desirable to create some pretty massive chains, for example a service the does deposits and withdrawals. Deposits go into 1 wallet, withdrawals come out from another wallet. The deposit wallet batch sends money to the withdrawal wallet with an extremely low feerate (e.g. 10 sat/byte) for it to get confirmed when there's not much network activity (e.g. weekends).\r\n\r\nBut this means the \"withdrawal wallet\" will be doing hundreds or thousands of sends for every receive it as, so by necessity create a long transaction chain and keep bumping into the unconfirmed chain limit pretty easily.
