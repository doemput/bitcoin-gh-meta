   "body" : "The user creates a new wallet by running `./bitcoind -hdwatchonly=[ExtPubKey base58]`.\r\n\r\nThis make it possible to use methods like `getnewaddress`, `fundrawtransaction` and all normal wallet operations on a HD pubkey.\r\n\r\nSoftware built on top of core which need to delegate signing operations to hardware wallet will have almost the same code as if signing was done by Core.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of a standard for dealing with hardware wallet signing in the future, I expect that `signrawtransaction` will just delegate the signing to the hardware wallet.\r\n\r\nIn this way, there will be no code difference between software using third party solution for signing, and those just using core for signing.\r\n\r\nI will use it in my own projects. My HW is giving me the ExtPubKey, and I want to use bitcoin core just for coin selection and tracking. I also did not wanted to break bunch of old code. Ping @jonasschnelli \r\n",
