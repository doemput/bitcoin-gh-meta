   "body" : "@sipa This was the alternate approach to #9700 that I came up with.\r\n\r\nHere I tried to create a new wrapper class around `CTransaction` that would hold the validation-specific information, and then made `CTransactionRef` refer to that wrapper.  However, because blocks contain a vector of CTransactionRef's, I didn't see a way to avoid this validation-specific wrapper from being in `primitives/`.\r\n\r\nAlso, the last commit here is designed to make sure that CTransactionRef remains thread-safe, by using std::call_once to calculate the segwit cache on demand.  I really dislike adding synchronization primitives here but felt I needed to include something to address thread-safety concerns.  However it occurred to me that the solution I tried to use in #9700 was to add a deserialization flag to control whether the cache was populated on construction, and perhaps that would be a better approach here as well?  I'm open to whatever suggestions people have to make caching these hashes workable...",
