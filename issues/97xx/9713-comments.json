This PR actually contains two commits from master - the first is https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9707 and the second is the commit for this PR (fixing error causes/messages in net.cpp). Looks like you've reviewed both in this PR.\r\n\r\nI was going to look at removing `assert_raises()` and `assert_raises_message()` in a future PR, but it looks like there's actually only two cases of them being used (in p2p-segwit.py and signrawtransactions.py) so I'll go ahead and add that to #9707 ",
