      "body" : "@rebroad BIP 130 has already been implemented and allows peers to opt-in to receiving block announcements via headers, specifically to maintain backwards compatibility and not require all software on the network adopt the protocol change.  This patch only makes the behavior more confusing (as it needlessly breaks BIP 130's opt-in protocol) and less flexible (as peers which make use of getheaders are now forced to receive block announcements this way as well, which could break other participants on the network).  This is why I NACKed this when you proposed it in #8961.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I do think we could propose eliminating block inv's altogether, which has been suggested before.  But that is a topic that should first be discussed more broadly, eg on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, as it would affect all software on the peer-to-peer network.",
