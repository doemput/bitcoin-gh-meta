   "body" : "Notes:\r\n* The LevelDB patch here is simple, and makes it switch to c++11 atomics when available over their MemoryBarrier() based solutions. A slightly better version is submitted upstream as https://github.com/google/leveldb/pull/449.\r\n* Several race fixes are not bug fixes (the numThreads one and the access to globals one both happen before any multithreaded access to those variables takes place; and the LevelDB one is due to tsan not recognizing the inline assembly used in MemoryBarrier), but in general improvements that result in less fragile code.\r\n\r\nAfter these, I believe our unit and rpc tests are clean for asan/lsan/ubsan/tsan, but:\r\n* The BDB environment holds locks that cross call stacks, and trigger the tsan deadlock detection. To avoid, create a suppressions file with the line `deadlock:__db_pthread_mutex_lock` in it, and pass an environment variable `TSAN_OPTIONS=\"suppressions=$file\"` to the binaries.\r\n* The zapwallettxn RPC test causes an assertion failure inside libtsan for me.\r\n* You need to compile with `-DBOOST_SP_USE_STD_ATOMIC` to avoid tsan incorrectly detecting signals2 calls as racy (boost uses inline assembly for atomic refcounting by default, unless this compile options is passed; it was introduced in 1.54 I think).\r\n\r\nAs tsan seems to become a usable option for race detection, I wonder if over time we could remove our own DEBUG_LOCKORDER features.",
