      "body" : "> A nice addition to this would be listing the found BDB version (and or maybe the BDB CLAGS) in the configure summary.\r\n\r\nI thought about that. But well we don't really detect the BDB version, there's just a 4.8-check-or-not (which gets skipped if you manually provide these environment variables). May be worth doing at some point, but not as part of this pull.\r\n(we'd also have to decide what flags for which dependencies to list - listing them all would be a huge list)",
