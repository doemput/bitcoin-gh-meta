   "body" : "The `bumpfee()` RPC was returning misleading or incorrect error codes\r\n(for example RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY when the transaction was not\r\nBIP125 replacable). This PR changes those error codes to what I think are\r\nmore sensible:\r\n\r\n[EDITED]\r\n- RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY if an invalid address was provided:\r\n    - Invalid change address given\r\n- RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if a single (non-address/key) parameter is incorrect\r\n    - confTarget and totalFee options should not both be set.\r\n    - Invalid confTarget\r\n    - Insufficient totalFee (cannot be less than required fee)\r\n- RPC_WALLET_ERROR for any other error\r\n    - Transaction has descendants in the wallet\r\n    - Transaction has descendants in the mempool\r\n    - Transaction has been mined, or is conflicted with a mined transaction\r\n    - Transaction is not BIP 125 replaceable\r\n    - Transaction has already been bumped\r\n    - Transaction contains inputs that don't belong to the wallet\r\n    - Transaction has multiple change outputs\r\n    - Transaction does not have a change output\r\n    - Fee is higher than maxTxFee\r\n    - New fee rate is less than the minimum fee rate\r\n    - Change output is too small.\r\n\r\n[/EDITED]\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the test cases to explicitly test the error code.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on top of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9707\r\n\r\n[EDIT: updated error codes/classes of error above]",
