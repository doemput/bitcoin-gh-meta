That both means implementation detals don't leak out (visibly or invisibly).\r\n\r\nI also don't think libconsensus should be implementing any standardness checks. They're policy, and not part of libconsensus' goal (which is to be policy neutral, and just provide the one thing that is too risky to reimplement).",

      "body" : "@sipa let's take the scenario I laid out as an example. Say there are 2 versions of libbitcoinconsensus in the wild, one that includes VERIFY_DERSIG externally and one that doesn't (regardless of whether it's a 1:1 flag mapping or not). Dev builds a program against the new version with the flag and releases it. user runs against the older version of the lib without the flag.\r\n\r\nIf I'm understanding correctly, it sounds as though you want an actual mapping function that's hit before feeding the flags into VerifyScript(), so that the passed-in flags are never used directly?\r\n\r\nIn this case, what would happen for the user? The map function sees a VERIFY_DERSIG which is not exposed externally. Does it simply immediately fail?",
