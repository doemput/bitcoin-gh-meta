The url IP address is not the issue. (I also currently have bitcoind processes on the same computers talking to one another. Both the local bitcoind and the remote bitcoind daemons are using the same user ID and passwords.)\r\n\r\nI deleted the \"config\" file option to see if that makes a difference.  No difference in behaviors for either the broken BFG-testnet-GBT-Solo-remote.conf configuration file or the functioning BFG-testNet-GBT-Solo-local.conf configuration file that executes properly.\r\n\r\nConcerning stratum and getwork, I have different bfgminer config files the exercises stratum and getwork capabilities.  For example,  my BFG-testNet-GWK-Solo-local.conf file (not mentioned in the thread above) contains to force getwork to be used:\r\n\r\n\"no-stratum\" : true,\r\n\"no-gbt\" : true,\r\n\r\nAs you already know, bfgminer provides visual feedback as to what mining protocol is being used. (Granted I like to use of GBT because it provides individual miners autonomy as to what transactions they want to mine as opposed to stratum where all miners are mining what the pool says...) \r\n\r\nWhile I have your attention: \r\n\r\n1) What git \"tag\" from  https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer.git does http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/bfgminer/5.0.0/bfgminer-5.0.0.zip map to? \r\n2) Is bfgminer now supporting out of tree builds since the following configure flags, associated with cross compiling, are listed in the associated \"bfgminer-5.0.0/configure\"?\r\n  System types:\r\n    --build=BUILD     configure for building on BUILD [guessed]\r\n    --host=HOST       cross-compile to build programs to run on HOST [BUILD]\r\n    --target=TARGET   configure for building compilers for TARGET [HOST]\r\n\r\n3) If this continues to be a bfgminer discussion is it more appropriate to be moved to https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer/issues?\r\n\r\nThanks for your assistance.\r\n\r\nFYSA - I like mining at http://eligius.st:-)\r\n",

From experimenting/testing, I'm also starting to notice a few other quirks with v0.9.4. For example, the difficulty factor is alway unity.

Very little documentation exist for using it. Think I'll switch gears back to that track...\r\n\r\nThanks for your assistance:-)",
