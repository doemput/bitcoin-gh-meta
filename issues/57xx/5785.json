   "body" : "The content below makes more sense when referencing the diagram at https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#solo-mining.\r\n\r\nCurrently running mainNet and testNet bitcoind v0.9.4 instances on an OS X 10.10 laptop and an OS X 10.9 MacMini, for a total of four blockchains. Also running bfgminer 5.0.0 (http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/bfgminer/5.0.0/bfgminer-5.0.0.zip) on both computers.  Was able to successfully get bfgminer to communicate with bitcoind instances (mainNet and testNet) on the localhost using GetBlockTemplate & Stratum & GetWork.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I can't get bfgminer on one computer to communicate to a bitcoind instance on the other computer. Yet the bitcoind instances on the laptop and the MacMini communicate just fine, no known firewall issues.  (The dedicated MacMini is effectively being used a proxy/relay for the laptop that frequently connects and disconnects <by having \"connect=192.168.222.50\" within the laptop's bitcoin.conf file>, for quick blockchain synchronizations.)\r\n\r\nFor the MacMini proxy, the testnet config contain an \"rpcallowip=192.168.222.0/24\" statement which should allow for communication between the two computers on the private 192.168.222 Class C network.  Pointing the bfgminer on the laptop (having a USB-based ASIC device attached) to the Macmini fails for all three mining protocols.  I initially thought it was a bfgminer issue, but now I believe it is a bitcoind issue because when I point my Antminer C1 to the bitcoind it also never connects.\r\n\r\nIs there something I'm not doing right? Is there some other secret sauce I need to know about?\r\n\r\nFYSA - I'm only tweaking working bfgminer JSON instances to point a miner in a different direction. Been doing this for a while.\r\n\r\n",
