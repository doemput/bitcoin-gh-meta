It begins the install process, but failed with \"Error opening file for writing: C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe[...]\". I aborted that install attempt.\r\n\r\nNext, I right clicked on the installer, selected Run as Administrator. That install worked fine, but on the last page, it automatically launches bitcoin-qt for you. I was surprised (I guess I should have expected this) because the instance of bitcoin-qt created its profile under the administrator account (including a new wallet.dat).\r\n\r\ntl;dr - The windows Bitcoin installer should be UAC aware.",
