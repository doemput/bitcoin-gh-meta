We already have the sync progress bar and the text warning to the left of it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about adding a red or yellow caution to the right of the warning text, to draw attention to it? That seems to best fit with what already exists. Augmenting instead of duplicating. I could change the mouse over text from the sync bar/text to reflect the extra warnings you describe, and add this mouse over to the new warning icon as well.\r\n\r\nHow does all that sound?",

But at least a click-away action is required. Once the layer has been clicked away, we could go back to the current state where we show the exclamation mark warning icons",
