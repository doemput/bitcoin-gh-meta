For pruning there may be an additional constraints (and/or a few old blocks may have to be re-downloaded, to ensure that the last 550MB of blocks is there), but I don't see why it couldn't work in principle, and it'd still be possible to restore much faster than starting entirely from scratch.\r\n\r\nEdit: Hm thinking about this that may not even be necessary. If the database backup is not too old, from before the last pruned block, it would just revisit the blocks on disk and end up where it left.",

This saves disk space, as the backup can share many files with the live database. Also, it means the backup happens nearly instantly, only taking time to create the new links to the inodes. In my setup, I do shut down the node while taking the snapshot of the database, but if this functionality were built in, presumably the database could simply be closed briefly while the snapshot is made, and the whole process wouldn't have exit.\r\n\r\nI guess there is some kind of equivalent of hard links on Windows. Not as elegant as the Unix way, but it should still work as well, I'd think.",
