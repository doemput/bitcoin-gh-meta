   "body" : "During some lock debugging on a dual-core Linux system I noticed that threads are blocked acquiring `cs_vNodes` and `cs_main` for long periods when the system is under moderate load from unrelated processes -- the unlucky lock acquirer is waiting for single-digit seconds once every 10 minutes or so (not coinciding with new blocks) up to around a 30 second wait every few hours. It looks like `ThreadMessageHandler` is taking locks and then due to being set to `THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL`, it's being descheduled (even in trivial lock-holding regions like `GetHeight`) and holding up for arbitrarily long periods other threads that use these core locks.\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering, what are the benefits of running the message handler at low priority?",
