This requires a lot more engineering effort, and in some cases commitment techniques are insufficient as you really do need proof-of-publication of arbitrary data.",

I intend to fix this when I find time, and at the same time re-propose making bare multisig relaying disabled by default (but not as a side effect of this policy).

I'm aware of the acutal cost, in terms of sigops allowed in a block, so I'm wondering, whether we can get away with counting the ops two times.",
