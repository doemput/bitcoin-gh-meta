   "body" : "Currently the wallet shows warning triangles on the \"Overview\" page when the client is not synced.\r\n\r\nLooking at the volume of mail I receive from people confused by unsynced client behavior, as well as issues like #7235 this is not enough.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to:\r\n\r\n- Make the warning look more serious. E.g. make the icons red or yellow instead of the same color as the rest.\r\n- The warning should appear on every page, not just Overview but also when receiving or sending transactions. Possibly on the bottom bar.\r\n- Mouseover should warn that:\r\n  - Transactions are not up to date -  most notably, received transactions more recent than the current synchronization time are not yet visible. This should be made really, really clear.\r\n  - Balance is not up to date - it does already say this implicitly by showing the triangle next to the balance and recent transactions, but not everyone picks up this hint.\r\n  - Fee estimation is not up to date/incomplete - maybe we need a separate warning for this on the \"Send\" page.\r\n",
