   "body" : "in v0.12 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7081 (by @luke-jr) was merged adding `-bytespersigop` (with default of 20).\r\n\r\nthis is preventing simple bare multisig transactions from being accepted into mempool when the size is < 400 bytes.  \r\neg; https://gist.github.com/rubensayshi/ac4f617207f7a50559e85d61c05800be\r\n\r\nfrom 1-of-7 and onwards they are accepted because the ratio of bytes:sigops is high enough.  \r\nalso having 2 or more inputs will work because it again tips the ratio of bytes:sigops over.\r\n\r\nthe reason mainly being that `GetLegacySigOpCount` calls `GetSigOpCount` with `fAccurate=false`.\r\n\r\nIt looks like changing `GetLegacySigOpCount` to use `fAccurate=true` would cause side effects in the few other places (`ConnectBlock`, `CheckBlock`, `CreateNewBlock`) and simply adding `fAccurate` as arg to `GetLegacySigOpCount` would affect the value stored in `CTxMemPoolEntry.sigOpCount` which in turn affects a bunch of other things.",
