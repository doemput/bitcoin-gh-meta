   "body" : "This mostly only matters when testing, but it takes a long time for Ctrl+C to interrupt anything during initial startup because `fRequestShutdown` isn't checked much. (Also, `fRequestShutdown` is currently accessed across threads without synchronization.) We could put in more `fRequestShutdown` checks but init calls into some long-running main functions that already check for shutdown via boost's interrupt mechanism; a consistent solution would be preferable.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be to put everything in boost threads and use boost interruption everywhere (main could join the WaitForShutdown thread rather than calling it in main's thread). AppInit2 doesn't expect interruption and would need modifications to handle that exit path correctly, but the interruption points that already exist in the main code would make startup much more abortable. The consistency with the rest of the code would also be a plus and would allow a better implementation of #8063 that isn't practical with `fRequestShutdown`.",
